a modest reduction in fasting plasma glu-cose, in keeping with the pharmacoki-netic proﬁle of exenatide, and yet asigniﬁcant drop in A1C strongly suggestsa robust effect of exenatide on postpran-dial plasma glucose concentrations. Thisis conﬁrmed by the sustained reductionsin postprandial glucose concentrationsobserved in the meal challenge test atweeks 4 and 30. Incremental plasma glu-cose AUC and average concentration dur-ing the postprandial period were reducedby/H1101160% (5-/H9262g arm) and 90% (10-/H9262g arm) by exenatide treatment. Because the magnitude of any fall in A1C is dependent upon a number of fac-tors (e.g., baseline A1C, background ther-apy, and endogenous /H9252-cell function), it is not possible to directly compare the ef-ﬁcacy of exenatide in this population to theeffects of other agents, as no comparabletrial data are currently available. Perhaps abetter measure of efﬁcacy is to examine the
