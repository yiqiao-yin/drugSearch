Therefore, the present study designincluded an acclimation period (4 weeks)at a lower exenatide ﬁxed dose (5 /H9262g b.i.d.) in treatment arms A and B, beforethe ﬁxed dose of exenatide was either in-creased to 10 /H9262g b.i.d. (arm B) or re- mained at 5 /H9262g b.i.d. (arm A) for the duration of the study. Equivalent volumesof placebo to those administered to armsA and B were administered in treatmentarms C and D. Study medication was self-injected subcutaneously in the abdomenwithin 15 min before meals in the morn-ing and evening. In an effort to standardize sulfonyl-
