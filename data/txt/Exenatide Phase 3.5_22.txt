P/H110050.0008; Fig. 2C]. The proportion of patients achiev- ing FPG of 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/liter) or less at wk 24was greater for ExQW (50.4%) compared with ExBID(30.9%; treatment difference adjusted P/H110050.0008). Similar to previous results with ExBID and ExQW (16, 19), antibody status had no overall predictable effect on thechange in HbA1c (Fig. 2D). The HbA1c changes in ExQWpatients with low treatment-emergent antibody to exenatidetiter (/H11021625; n/H1100551) and antibody-negative patients (n /H1100544) at the last visit on or before wk 24 were similar; ExQWpatients with higher treatment-emergent antibody to ex-enatide titers ( /H11350625) (n /H1100528), exhibited a variable HbA1c change, from /H110024.1% to /H110012.4%. ExBID patients remaining antibody negative (n /H1100557) had a similar mean change in HbA1c compared with ExBID patients with low antibody toTABLE 1.
