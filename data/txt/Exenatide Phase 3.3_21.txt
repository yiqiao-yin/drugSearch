Of patients included in the completer analysis, 67 (48%) of 140 given exenatide versus 56 (38%) of 147 given glargine achieved HbA 1c  concentrations of less than 7·0% (53 mmol/mol; p=0·046), and 39 (28%) of 140 given exenatide versus 26 (18%) of 147 given glargine achieved concentrations of 6·5% (48 mmol/mol) or less (p=0·025). Throughout the study, least-squares mean FSG  concentrations were lower in patients given glargine than in those given exenatide (ﬁ  gure 2B).
