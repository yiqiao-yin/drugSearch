in the exenatide-treated patients in adose-dependent fashion. Events were ofmild or moderate intensity with no severehypoglycemia reported (requiring the as-sistance of another person). Interestingly,exenatide itself does not appear to intrin-sically increase the risk of hypoglycemiabecause in a similarly designed study,when it was added to a background ofmetformin therapy, there was no increasein reported hypoglycemia, even thoughoverall glycemia had improved (38). Withthis in mind, it is possible to speculatethat the increase in hypoglycemia ob-served in this study was likely caused bythe background susceptibility to hypogly-cemia often observed in sulfonylurea-treated patients coupled with lowerambient glycemia. In summary, exenatide reduced HbA 1cand was associated with sustained weight loss. The most frequent adverse
