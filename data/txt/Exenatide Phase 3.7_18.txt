Sample size was calculated from previous studies of exenatide QW, estimating an HbA1c reduction of −0.35% ( −3.8 mmol/mol) for exenatide QW vs placebo. To detect this difference with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1% (12.0 mmol/mol), 209 participants per groupwere required for 90% power at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 (see Supplementary Methods online for full description, File S1). Hypothesis testing of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints followed a serial gatekeeping procedure to control for family-wise type I error rate (see Supplementary Methods online for a full description of testing sequence, File S1). Superiority of exenatideQW vs placebo was required at a 2-sided significance level of P< .05 for sequential testing to proceed. Once a hypothesis test failed, no statistical significance could be claimed and Pvalues were nominal for the remaining endpoints in the sequence. Nominal Pvalues were reported for exploratory endpoints and were not adjusted for multi-
