ExQW vs.ExBID. B, Proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c targets at wk 24. *, P/H110210.0001 ExQW vs.ExBID ( Pvalue for HbA1c /H110217.0% adjusted using the Hochberg procedure). C, LS mean/H11006SEchange in fasting plasma glucose concentration from baseline to wk 24. *, P/H11021 0.05, ExQW vs.ExBID ( Pvalue at wk 24 adjusted using the Hochberg procedure). FPG concentration conversion factor (milligrams per deciliter to millimoles per liter) is 0.0555. D,Scatterplot of change in HbA1c by treatment-emergent antibody status at last visit (on orbefore wk 24); solid lines indicate mean change in HbA1c; low titer is /H11021625; higher titer is /H11350625 E, LS mean /H11006 SEchange in body weight from baseline to wk 24. *, P/H110210.05 ExQW vs. ExBID. F, Scatterplot of change in HbA1c vs.change in body weight from baseline to wk 24. Data are presented for the ITT population: ExQW, n /H11005129; ExBID, n /H11005123; missing
