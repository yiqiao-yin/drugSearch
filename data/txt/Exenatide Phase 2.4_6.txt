side effects can potentially restrict the use of optimally effective doses of therapeutic agents. Thus, during drugdevelopment, an early approach to establish the potential for inducing tolerance to dose-limiting side effects of a therapeutic agent could be useful. This study was designedto formally assess the potential induction of tolerance to the nausea and vomiting associated with exenatide administration. The methodology utilized herein mayhave broad applicability in managing dose-limiting sideeffects during Phase 2 clinical trials of other drugs to facilitate establishment of optimal dosing regimens. Materials and methods Study subjects A total of 123 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited at 31 sites in the United States. Subjectswere males, or females who were surgically sterile or postmenopausal, aged 18 to 65 years, with the following characteristics: (1 ) fasting blood glucose (FPG)
