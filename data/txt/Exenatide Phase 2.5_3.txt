Despite the use of traditional thera-pies, it is often difﬁcult to both achieveand maintain adequate glycemic controlin the majority of patients with type 2 dia-betes. Indeed, population-based glycemiccontrol has not improved substantially inthe past decade, with current A1C values/H113508% in many patients (6,7). In addition,many of the currently available ther apeutic agents have treatment-limiting side ef-fects, such as weight gain, hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal intolerance, and periph-eral edema, any of which may limit theuse of some agents, reduce treatmentcompliance, and make it difﬁcult toachieve glycemic treatment targets (8,9).
