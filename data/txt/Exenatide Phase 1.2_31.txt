tions returned to baseline, with little difference observed among the active treatments and placebo. The peak meanincremental serum insulin concentrations, in order fromhighest to lowest AC2993 dose, were 25.6 /H110064.5 /H9262U/ml (177.8/H1100631.3 pmol/liter; 0.2 /H9262g/kg), 20.0 /H110062.9/H9262U/ml (138.9/H1100620.1 pmol/liter; 0.1 /H9262g/kg), 8.8 /H110061.5/H9262U/ml (61.1 /H11006 10.4 pmol/liter; 0.05 /H9262g/kg), and 0.9 /H110061.3/H9262U/ml (6.3 /H110069.0 pmol/liter; placebo). Insulin AUC(0–8h )and Cmaxvalues for all AC2993 treatments increased in an apparently dose- dependent manner, compared with placebo. AUC(0–8h )val- ues increased 92% (0.2 /H9262g/kg), 44% (0.1 /H9262g/kg), and 19% (0.05/H9262g/kg), compared with placebo. Fasting plasma glucagon. Within the firs t 3 h after AC2993
