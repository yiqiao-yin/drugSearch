B, C, or D in a 2:2:1:1 ratio). A minimum sample size of 300 subjects with at leastone postbaseline HbA 1cmeasurement was estimated to provide /H1101190% power to detect a difference of 0.6% in the changefrom baseline in HbA 1cmeasurement be - tween at least one exenatide treatmentarm and placebo ( /H9251/H110050.05; Fisher’s pro- tected testing procedure). Placebo arms Cand D were combined for all analyses. All inferential statistical tests wereconducted at a signiﬁcance level of 0.05 (two-sided). A general linear model wasused to test for differences in the changefrom baseline to each visit in HbA 1cand weight across treatments (28,29). Factors in the model included treatment (placeboand two active treatment arms), strata ofbaseline HbA 1c(/H110219.0% and /H113509.0%), and study site as ﬁxed effects. Before data analysis, sites were pooled according togeographic location to prevent loss of toomany degrees of freedom in the model.
