metformin regimen. To standardize sul-fonylurea use in the clinical trial, subjectswere randomized (one for one) to eithermaximally effective sulfonylurea dose(MAX group; 4 mg/day glimepiride, 20mg/day glipizide, 10 mg/day glipizide XL,10 mg/day glibenclamide [glyburide], 6mg/day micronized glibenclamide, 350mg/day chlorpropamide, 500 mg/day to-lazamide, or 1,500 mg/day tolbutamide)or to minimum recommended dose (MINgroup; 1 mg/day glimepiride, 5 mg/dayglipizide, 5 mg/day glipizide XL, 1.25 mg/day glibenclamide, 0.75 mg/day micron-ized glibenclamide, 100 mg/day chlorpropamide, 100 mg/day tolaz-amide, or 250 mg/day tolbutamide).This approach allowed assessment of theinï¬‚uence of concurrent sulfonylurea dos-ing on hypoglycemia risk. The assign-ment to the sulfonylurea managementgroup was not blinded. During the blinded phase of the
