ication. The ITT population was assessed for allanalyses, except where noted. Missing datawere imputed using the last observation car-ried forward (LOCF) method for the ITT pop-ulation; analyses of end points only includedsubjects who had at least one post-baselinevalue. An analysis of the completer populationwithout LOCF was also conducted and com-pared with the ITT LOCF analysis to determineif bias was introduced by the imputationmethod. No difference between the conclusionsfrom each analysis was observed; therefore,ITT analysis is presented. The null hypothesisto be tested was that there was no differenceamong all treatment groups, and the alterna-tive hypothesis was that there was a decreas-ing monotone relationship between the changein HbA 1cand doses. The doseâ€“response rela- tionship was investigated by statistical testingof a linear contrast. 24Study end points were HbA 1c, FPG, and body weight from Day 1
