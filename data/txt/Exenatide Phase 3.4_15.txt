achieved HbA 1c#6.5% after 26 weeks, versus MET- and SITA-treated patients(P= 0.004 and P,0.001, respectively). LS mean baseline fasting serum glucose values ranged from 9.7 to 9.9 mmol/Lacross treatment groups. Reductions infasting serum glucose at 16 and 26 weeks were signi ﬁcantly greater in patients treated with EQW versus SITA (both P,0.001). LS mean (SE) reductions in fasting serumglucose at 26 weeks were 22.3 mmol/L (0.1 mmol/L) in patients treated with EQW;22.0 mmol/L (0.1 mmol/L) with MET ( P=0 . 1 5 5v s .E Q W ) ; 22.6 mmol/L (0.2 mmol/L) with PIO ( P=0 . 1 5 3v s . EQW); and 21.1 mmol/L (0.2 mmol/L) with SITA ( P,0.001 vs. EQW). Mean seven-point SMBG pro ﬁles showed similar reductions in blood glu- cose from baseline to 26 weeks in EQW,MET, and PIO treatment groups (Supple- mentary Figs. 1 A–C). There were no sig- niﬁcant differences between EQW versus MET or PIO treatment groups with regardto changes from baseline for any of the seven time points or for daily mean
