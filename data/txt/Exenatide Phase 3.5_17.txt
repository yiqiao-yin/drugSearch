of all ITT patients completing study procedures through at leastwk 20 in compliance with the protocol and receiving adequatestudy medication exposure. With the exception of safety andsubgroup analyses, performed for the ITT population only, allanalyses were performed for both the ITT and evaluable popu-lations. Missing postbaseline efficacy data were imputed usingthe last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. As asensitivity analysis, the change in HbA1c was evaluated using allobserved postbaseline data (without imputation) in a mixed-effects model repeated-measure analysis (change in HbA1c asdependent variable; treatment, week, treatment by week inter-action, concomitant SU use at screening, and baseline HbA1cstratum as fixed effects; subject as random effect). Efficacy dataon mean changes from baseline were expressed as least squares(LS) means. The statistical analyses were performed using SASversion 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
