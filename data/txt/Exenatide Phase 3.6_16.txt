mapped to the next scheduled visit. We used an unstruc-tured covariance matrix. We analysed concentrations of C-reactive protein (assessed with a high-sensitivity assay) and B-type natriuretic peptide with a last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, which was similar to the MMRM model. Subgroup analyses of change in HbA 1c at endpoint used  a LOCF-ANCOVA model similar to the models for C-reactive protein and B-type (brain) natriuretic peptide, and included subgroup and interaction between treatment and subgroup. We used a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel model to analyse the proportion of patients achieving HbA 1c targets at LOCF endpoint, with adjustments for  HbA1c stratum, country, and stratum of oral antihyper- glycaemic drugs for the intention-to-treat population. Endpoint data for continuous variables are presented  as least-squares mean estimates from the statistical  Exenatide (N=461) Liraglutide (N=450) Age (years) 57 (9·4) 57 (9·6) Sex
