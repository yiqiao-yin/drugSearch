dose unchanged; FPG 5.6 to 8.5 mmol/L [100-153 mg/dL], +2 units;FPG >8.5 mmol/L [>153 mg/dL], +4 units [Table S2 in File S1]) toachieve an FPG of 4.0 to 5.5 mmol/L (72-99 mg/dL) without hypo-glycaemia. 28IG was administered at the same time each day, prefera- bly at bedtime. Adjustments of the IG dose according to the INITIATE algorithm could occur during scheduled visits at weeks −8, −4 and −1 or between visits, either by the patient or the investigator, based on the average of 3 consecutive FPG measurements. Investiga-tors could deviate from the algorithm based on their clinical judg-ment. Patients with an inclusive HbA1c of 7.0% to 10.5%(53-91 mmol/mol) after the IG titration phase were eligible forrandomization. All patients provided written informed consent. The study proto- col was approved by institutional review boards at each site. Thestudy was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinkiand Good Clinical Practice guidelines. 2.2 |Randomization
