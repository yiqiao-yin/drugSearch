in both groups (p<0·0001), but the decrease was greater in patients in the liraglutide group than in those in the exenatide group (0·02; table 2). Patients in both groups had similar decreases in blood pressure (table 2). Im-provements in other cardiovascular biomarkers (lipids, C-reactive protein, and brain natriuretic peptide) were similar between groups at endpoint (table 2). Mean DMSAT and PHQ-8 total scores improved in both treatment groups (p<0·0001), with no signiﬁ  cant diﬀ  er- ences in total scores between groups (data not shown). The most common adverse events were mainly gastro- intestinal in both groups, with a greater frequency of nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting in patients in the liraglutide group than in those in the exenatide group (table 3). Events of nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting occurred more frequently at the start of treatment in both groups, with incidence decreasing over time (ﬁ gure 4). 24 (5%) patients in the liraglutide group
