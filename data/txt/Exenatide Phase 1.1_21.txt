sulin concentrations peaked by 2hours for all treatment groups. By 8hours after the defined-calorie meal,plasma insulin concentrations hadreturned to near-baseline levels inthe placebo group but remainedabove baseline levels for all exenatidegroups. Baseline plasma glucagon concen- trations were similar across treat-ment groups in study A (Figure 3B).By 20 minutes postdose, plasma glu-cagon concentrations for all exenatidetreatment groups were lower thanthose of the placebo group. By3 hours postdose, plasma glucagonconcentrations in the exenatidegroups were lower than their respec-tive baseline values and at least45 ng/L lower than the mean gluca-gon concentration in the placebogroup.  All exenatide groups had sig- nificantly reduced glucagon AUC 0–3 hr values compared with placebo ( p ≤ 0.0006). The corresponding mean AUC0–3 hr values for the 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.3-, and 0.4-µg/kg exenatide groups were 218, 186, 209, and 163 ng • hr/L, compared with 331 ng • hr/L for pla-
