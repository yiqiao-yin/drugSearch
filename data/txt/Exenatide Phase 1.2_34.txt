ster, exendin-4 is found to circulate after ingestion of a meal(35) and therefore may have endocrine functions related tometabolic control in the lizard. Exendin-4 has a 53% aminoacid sequence overlap with mammalian GLP-1. However,exendin-4 is not a product of the proglucagon gene. It is theproduct of a separate gene (not a homolog) that is distinctfrom the proglucagon gene from which GLP-1 is expressedin the Gila monster (36). Unlike GLP-1, which is degradedwithin 1 â€“2 min by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV when adminis- tered sc, exendin-4 is resistant to dipeptidyl peptidase-IVdegradation and more readily available for exerting manybeneficial metabolic effects similar to GLP-1 (37). AC2993 has been reported to exhibit a number of acute and longer-term actions in animal models that may account forits glucose-lowering effects in humans. Insulinotropism (14),
