improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure with  continued use for 3.5 years. 11 In the current study,  exenatide monotherapy was associated with systolic  blood pressure reductions of -3.7 mm Hg in both  exenatide groups. Also, exenatide monotherapy was  associated with diastolic blood pressure reductions of  -0.8 and -2.3 mm Hg in the 5- and 10-pg groups, re-  spectively. These findings are clinically important given  that a meta-analysis of 61 prospective observational  studies of blood pressure and mortality, which evalu-  ated individual data from 1 million adults, reported  that reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure was  associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular-  related death. 3° A decrease in mean systolic blood  pressure as small as 2 mm Hg has been associated  with a 7% reduction in ischemic heart disease-related  mortality and a 10% reduction in stroke mortality in  the general population. 3° Greater improvements in
