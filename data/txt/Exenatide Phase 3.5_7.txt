An incretin hormone secreted from the gut in response to food ingestion, GLP-1 has been demonstrated to play akey role in pancreatic /H9252-cell stimulation, insulin secretion, regulation of gastric emptying and satiety, and suppres-sion of inappropriate glucagon secretion (6â€“8). GLP-1infusion over 24 h has been demonstrated to normalizeblood glucose and both basal and stimulated /H9252-cell func- tion (9), demonstrating the potential role of continuousGLP-1 receptor agonism in improving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (10). Exenatide administered twice daily (ExBID), a well- characterized GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for use asan adjunct to diet and exercise, has been shown to promoteglycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and pro-duce weight loss; in addition, exenatide has been reportedto improve cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pres-sure and lipid profiles (11). Exenatide, like GLP-1, acts toenhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion by the pan-creatic
