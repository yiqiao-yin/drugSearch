cebo, despite lower baseline and post-prandial glucose concentrations (Fig.3C).Body weight Body weight averaged 100 kg across alltreatment arms at baseline (Fig. 1). Dur-ing the study, exenatide arms had pro-gressive weight loss from baseline (Fig.4A). Reductions in body weight were ob- served regardless of baseline BMI (Fig.4B). Insulin and proinsulin Baseline fasting insulin and proinsulinconcentrations were similar across treat-ment arms (Fig. 1). Despite the reductionin fasting plasma glucose concentrationsin the exenatide arms, there were no sig-niÔ¨Åcant differences in fasting plasma in-sulin concentrations from baseline in anytreatment arm ( /H110012.1/H110067.8 pmol/l [10 /H9262g],/H110023.5/H1100614.7 pmol/l [5 /H9262g],/H110025.6/H11006 10.4 pmol/l [placebo]). There was a trendtoward a decline in fasting plasma proin-sulin concentrations from baseline(/H110029.6/H110063.8 pmol/l [10 /H9262g],/H110025.2/H110065.9 pmol/l [5 /H9262g],/H110020.9/H110064.5 pmol/l [pla-
