Over 24 weeks, exenatide monotherapy was associ-  ated with improved HbAI~ and FSG levels, improved  postprandial glucose control, reduced weight, im-  proved [3-cell function (HOMA-B), and improved  blood pressure in these patients naive to antidiabetic  agents who had type 2 diabetes treated with diet and  exercise alone. Furthermore, exenatide monotherapy  was well tolerated, with a low incidence of hypoglyce-  mia (4%-5%) and no reported cases of severe hypo-  glycemia. These data suggest that exenatide mono- therapy may provide a viable treatment option beyond  diet and exercise.  Patients in the current study had a mean duration  of type 2 diabetes of -2 years, with mean HbAlc val-  ues at baseline of 7.8% to 7.9%. Reductions in HbAlc  (-0.7% and -0.9%) and FSG (-17.5 and -18.7 mg/dL)  in the exenatide 5- and 10-pg monotherapy groups,  respectively, were consistent overall with those ob-  served in previous placebo-controlled and open-label
