One patient in the exenatide group had acute pancreatitis for which ultra sonography showed cholelithiasis. The patient recovered, but was discontinued from the study. One patient in the exenatide group had a non-serious, asymptomatic case of pan-creatitis that led to discontinuation; however, a CT scan showed no evidence of acute pancreatitis. No episodes of major hypoglycaemia were reported. In patients taking concomitant sulfonylurea, 36 (12%) of those in the liraglutide group and 45 (15%) in the exenatide group had minor hypoglycaemia. In those not taking con-comitant sulfonylurea, minor hypoglycaemia occurred in four (3%) patients receiving liraglutide and in six (4%) receiving exenatide.Discussion This study is the ﬁ  rst head-to-head comparison of the eﬃ  cacy and safety of two longacting GLP-1 receptor
