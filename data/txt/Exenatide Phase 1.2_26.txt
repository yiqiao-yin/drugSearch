concentrations, compared with placebo in the fasting state during the 8-h period of observation (Fig. 5A; P/H110210.0001). There was a trend indicating AC2993 at a dose of 0.1 /H9262g/kg lowered plasma glucose more than 0.05 /H9262g/kg; however, there were insufficient patients dosed in each group to do astatistical comparison. No additional effect on glucose wasobserved at 0.2 /H9262g/kg, compared with 0.1 /H9262g/kg. The mean fasting plasma glucose nadir occurred between 3 and 4 hafter administration of AC2993. A t 3 h post dose, the mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations were 137.6 /H110069.4, 120.6/H110068.6, and 108.9 /H110066.7 mg/dl (6.0 /H110060.4, 6.7 /H110060.5, and 7.6/H110060.5 mmol/liter) for AC2993 0.2 /H9262g/kg, 0.1 /H9262g/kg, and0.05/H9262g/kg doses, respectively, compared with 195.0 /H1100613.2 mg/dl (10.8 /H110060.8 mmol/liter) for placebo. A t 4 h post dose, the mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations were 137.2 /H11006
