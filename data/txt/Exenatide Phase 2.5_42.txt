proportion of subjects in each speciﬁc treat- ment arm who were able to achieve an A1C/H113497% at the 10- and 5-/H9262 g ﬁxed doses of exenatide, which was 34 and 27% of sub-jects who completed the study, respec-tively, compared with 9% of subjects whoreceived placebo. These results are consistent with those reported in another 30-week, pla-cebo-controlled, phase 3 study (34) of theeffects of exenatide on glycemic controland safety in subjects with type 2 diabetesfailing to achieve glycemic control withsulfonylureas. In that study, at week 30,the 10-/H9262g exenatide b.i.d. arm had signif- icant placebo-adjusted reductions of/H110111.0% in A1C and 1.0 kg in weight. Inaddition, a reduction in the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio in the 10- /H9262g exenatide b.i.d. arm indicated that exenatide had a bene-ﬁcial effect on the /H9252-cell (34). In a parallel
