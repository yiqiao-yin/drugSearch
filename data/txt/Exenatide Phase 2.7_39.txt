The incidences of nausea (3%-13%) and vomiting  (4%) observed with exenatide monotherapy were lower  than in previous placebo-controlled and open-label  comparator (insulin) studies of exenatide in combina-  tion with oral antidiabetic agents, which reported  nausea in 33% to 57% of patients treated with exena-  tide and vomiting in 10% to 17%. 3-9 Hypoglycemia  was reported in 4 (5%), 3 (4%), and 1 (1%) patients  who received exenatide 5 and 10 gg and placebo, re-  spectively. Hypoglycemia rates per patient per year  were low (0.21 and 0.52 with exenatide), and no cases  of severe hypoglycemia were reported during this study.  These observations with regard to hypoglycemia are  consistent with exenatide's previously reported glucose-  dependent enhancement of insulin secretion.l,-~9  Exenatide in combination with oral antidiabetic  agents was previously reported in open-label exten-  sions (n = 151) of placebo-controlled studies 3-5 to
