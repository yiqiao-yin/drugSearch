among the treatment groups (Supplemen- tary Table 1). By week 12, 87% of patientstaking MET and 75% taking PIO had beentitrated to or above target doses for each agent (PIO 45 mg/day, MET 2,000 mg/day, respectively). At week 16 –26, patients were on stable doses: PIO ( $45 mg/day) 88% and MET ( $2,000 mg/day) 76%. Glycemic control and weight Mean baseline HbA 1cvalues ranged from 8.4 to 8.6% across treatment groups.Figure 2 Apresents the time course of HbA 1cchange from modi ﬁed MMRM analysis (intent-to-treat sample; all post- baseline observations included). Thismodi ﬁed analysis demonstrated LS mean (SE) reductions in HbA 1cat 26 weeks of 21.53% (0.07%) with EQW; 21.48% (0.07%) with MET ( P= 0.620 vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 20.26 to 0.17); 21.63% (0.08%) with PIO ( P= 0.328 vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 20.15 to 0.35); and 21.15% (0.08%) with SITA ( P,0.001 vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 20.62 to20.13).
