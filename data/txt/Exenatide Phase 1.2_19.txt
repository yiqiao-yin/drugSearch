baseline to a peak value of 289.0 /H1100617.0 mg/dl (16.0 /H110060.9 mmol/liter) at 120 min after dosing and decreased to 175.5 /H11006 14.9 mg/dl (9.7 /H110060.8 mmol/liter) at 300 min. In contrast, mean plasma glucose concentrations decreased from 159.5 /H11006 10.0 mg/dl (8.9 /H110060.6 mmol/liter) at baseline to a nadir of 126.4/H1100611.6 mg/dl (7.0 /H110060.6 mmol/liter) at 180 min and 177.8/H1100614.8 mg/dl (9.9 /H110060.8 mmol/liter) at 300 min during treatment with 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993 (d 5). Results were similaron d 1 (Fig. 1A) an d d 5 (Fig. 1B), and a similar effect was observed in each of the four study groups (Fig. 2). The reduction in glucose AUC(0–300min) following treat - ment with 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993 was statistically significant compared with placebo ( P/H110210.0001) on bot hd1a n dd5 .O n d 5, the least square mean incremental AUC(0–300min) de- creased 21,902 mg /H11003min per liter (1216 mmol /H11003min per liter)
