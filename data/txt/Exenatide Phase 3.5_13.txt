ExBID on the primary end point of change in HbA1c from base-line to wk 24. Secondary end points included body weight, FPG,proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c targets of less than 7%and 6.5% or less at wk 24, proportion of patients achieving FPGtarget of 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/liter) or less at wk 24, systolicblood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure, fasting lipidconcentrations, safety, and tolerability. Laboratory values Blood tests, including HbA1c, were performed by Quintiles Laboratories (Smyrna, GA) using standard methods. HbA1c wasmeasured by HPLC. Plasma concentrations of antibodies to ex-enatide were measured using a validated ELISA (20). Antibodytiters were determined by serial 1:5 dilutions after minimal di-lution of 1:25, with the titer expressed as the reciprocal of thehighest dilution of sample that tested positive. Antibody to ex-enatide titers less than 625 were classified as low and titers of 625or greater were classified as higher. Statistical analysis
