and placebo groups (5 [2.2%] vs 4 [1.7%] patients, respectively; nomi-nalP= .739) during the treatment period. 3.2.2 |Weight and other efficacy endpoints Patients receiving exenatide QW had significantly greater reductions in body weight from baseline to week 28 compared with those receiving placebo (LSM difference, −1.50 kg; 95% CI, −2.17 to −0.84; P< .001) (Table 2, Figure 2F). Reductions in body weight were appar- ent from week 8 (Figure 2F) and were maintained over the 28-weektreatment period. A greater proportion of patients achieved ≥5% body weight loss with exenatide QW than with placebo (6.9 percent-age point difference; nominal P= .004) (Table 2). More patients receiving exenatide QW vs placebo achieved HbA1c <7.0%TABLE 1 Demographic and baseline characteristics in the intention-to-treat population Characteristic Exenatide QW + IG (n = 231) Placebo + IG (n = 230) Total (N = 461) Age, years 57.8 /C69.0 57.6 /C610.3 57.7 /C69.7 Age≥65 years 50 (21.6) 58 (25.2) 108 (23.4)
