exenatide group versus 6·27 mmol/L (1·85) in the glargine group, and 8·89 mmol/L (2·42) in non-achievers in the exenatide group versus 7·53 mmol/L (2·49) in the glargine group. Least-squares mean reduction in FSG in goal achievers was –2·28 mmol/L (SE 0·27) in the exenatide group versus –3·07 mmol/L (0·31) in the glargine group (p=0·04; ﬁ  gure 3B). Mean glargine dose over time was similar in participants  who did not achieve HbA 1c control and in those who did
