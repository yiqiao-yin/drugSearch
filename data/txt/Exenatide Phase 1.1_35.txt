Inaddition, exenatide was still de tectable in plasma 15 hours after a single s.c.injection of doses greater than 0.2 µg/kg. This observation con firms the prolonged half-life of exenatide invivo, consistent with its resistance todegradation by dipeptidyl -peptidase IV (DPP-IV) as previously found inrats. 25 This is in sharp contrast to GLP-1, which is rapidly degraded af-ter s.c. injection (half-life, 1–2 min-utes) by the DPP-IV enzyme. 26,27 This observation could also be partiallyattributable to extended absorptionof exenatide into the blood from thes.c. injection site. In normoglycemicfasted rats, the single-phase decay ki-netics of s.c. exenatide (dose range,approximately 5–560  µg/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent blood half-liferanging from 90  ± 3 to 216 ± 13 min-
