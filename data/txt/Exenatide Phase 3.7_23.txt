Significantly more exenatideQW-treated patients vs placebo-treated patients achieved HbA1c <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) (32.5% vs 7.4%, respectively; P< .001) (Table 2, Figure 2B). Reductions in 2-hour PPG after an MTT were significantly greater with exenatide QW vs placebo (LSM difference,−1.52 mmol/L [ −27.5 mg/dL]; 95% CI, −2.15 to −0.90 mmol/L [ −38.7 to−16.2 mg/dL]; P< .001; final 2-hour PPG, 11.27 mmol/L [202.8 mg/dL] and 12.72 mmol/L [228.9 mg/dL], respectively) (Table 2, Figure 2C).Screened (N = 808)Did not enter IG titration: 297 (36.8%) 293 (36.3%) Screen failure1 (0.1%) Patient withdrawal 1 (0.1%) Study withdrawal criteria met 1 (0.1%) Incorrect insulin dose* 1 (0.1%) Unknown Entered IG titration (N = 511) 233 patients allocated to exenatide QWRandomized* (N = 464)Not randomized: 48 (9.4%) 20 (3.9%) Patient withdrawal
