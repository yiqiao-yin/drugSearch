tients were randomized to placebo or exenatide at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 /H9262g administered b.i.d. for 28 days. Results: After 28 days of therapy, exenatide was associated with significant ( P/H110210.0001, linear contrast testing), dose-dependent reductions in HbA 1c(0.1/H110060.1%, /H110020.3/H110060.1%, /H110020.4/H110060.1%, /H110020.5/H110060.0%, and /H110020.5/H110060.1% for placebo and 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. exenatide, respectively) and significant ( P/H110050.0006, linear contrast testing) reductions in fasting plasma glucose ( /H110016.8/H110064.1, /H1100220.1 /H110065.2, /H1100221.2 /H110063.9, /H1100217.7 /H110064.8, and /H1100217.3 /H110064.4 mg/dL for placebo and 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. exenatide, respectively) by Day 28. These reductions were similar for patients treated with
