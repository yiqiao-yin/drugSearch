tosamine from baseline between one ofthe AC2993 treatment groups and pla-cebo. The sample size also provided/H1101180% power to detect a statistically sig- niﬁcant difference ( /H9251/H11005 0.05) of a 1.7 mmol/l change in average postprandialplasma glucose from baseline betweenone of the AC2993 groups and placebo. Time-weighted averages over all post-meal time points were computed for days /H110021, 1, and 28 postprandial glucose con- centration values. The time-weighted av-erage was computed as the area under theconcentration–time curve (AUC) valueobtained using the trapezoidal rule di-vided by the sampling duration. Time-weighted averages were also calculatedfor postprandial lipids. RESULTS Study subjects
