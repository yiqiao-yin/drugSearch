emergent adverse event (headache and nausea [1 pa-  tient each]). Treatment-emergent adverse events reported  by >2% of exenatide-treated patients are shown in  Table II. The incidence of nausea was significantly  greater in the combined exenatide group (8%) versus  placebo (0%) (P = 0.010). No other significant differ-  ences in the incidences of these treatment-emergent  adverse events were observed between the combined  exenatide group and placebo.  Five percent (4/77), 4% (3/78), and 1% (1/77) of  patients in the exenatide 5- and 10-pg and placebo  groups, respectively, reported hypoglycemia (P = NS).  Hypoglycemia rates per patient per year were 0.21,  1454 Volume 30 Number 8
