1cvalues well above 8% (4–6,24). In addition, many available therapeutic treatments may not be tolerated by all pa-tients or may have undesirable side ef-fects, such as weight gain, hypoglycemia,and edema, that can impede the attain-ment of glycemic control and discourage patient compliance (1–6,25). Exenatide is an incretin mimetic, hav- ing glucoregulatory activities similar tothose of mammalian hormone GLP-1.These actions include glucose-dependentenhancement of insulin secretion, sup-pression of inappropriately high glucagonsecretion, and slowing of gastric emptying(7–12,26). Exenatide’s glucose-dependent enhancement of insulin secre-tion may be mediated by exenatidebinding to the pancreatic GLP-1 receptor(27). In animal models of diabetes and ininsulin-secretory cell lines, exenatide andGLP-1 reportedly improve /H9252-cell function
