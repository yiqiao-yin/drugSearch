reflecting that all exenatide doses had statisti-cally significant reductions in FPG comparedwith an increase in the placebo arms. Exenatidewas also associated with statistically signifi-cant, dose-dependent reductions in mean bodyweight by Day 28 in the 7.5 and 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. groups (Fig. 1C). However, body weight at endpoint was lower than baseline for each exe-natide dose studied. Placebo subjects remainedessentially weight neutral during the 28-daystudy. Subgroup analyses Figure 2 illustrates the 28-day responses for subgroups of subjects that were treated withdiet and exercise modifications alone versusmetformin. Data from the pooled placebogroup and 5.0 and 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. exenatide doses are shown (5.0 and 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. were the doses used in the long-term controlledstudies of exenatide). Mean reductions inHbA 1c(Fig. 2A), FPG (Fig. 2B), and body
