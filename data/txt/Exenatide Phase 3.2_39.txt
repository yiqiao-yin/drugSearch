systolic blood pressure. In contrast to a previous assessment of exenatide once- weekly [7], a signiﬁcant 52-week improvement in HDLcholesterol, but not total chole sterol and triglycerides, was observed. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, as thebaseline values for these lipid variables were comparable. Theﬁrst phase of this study [3] conﬁrmed the well-establishedeffects of pioglitazone [10] to decrease triglycerides andincrease total and HDL cholesterol. Treatment with exenatide once-weekly in these patients increased triglycerides and decreased LDL and HDL, such that these lipids were notsigniﬁcantly changed from origi nal baseline. While a signiﬁcant change in total cholesterol was not observed in patients treatedwith exenatide once-weekly for 52 weeks, switching toexenatide once-weekly from eith er sitagliptin or pioglitazone was associated with a signiﬁcant improvement in totalcholesterol. Overall, treatment with exenatide once-weekly for 52 weeks,
