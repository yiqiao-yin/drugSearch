any null hypothesis was rejected (i.e.,noninferiority was established), the corre-sponding superiority hypothesis was tested using the Hommel test (8) and decision ma- trix algorithm (9). The nominal signi ﬁcance level based on Hommel adjustment was be- tween 0.0167 and 0.05 depending on the noninferiority hypotheses rejected. The primary end point was tested using a maximum likelihood-based mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM)ANCOVA with change in HbA 1cas the de- pendent variable; treatment, baseline HbA 1c, country, week of visit, and treat- ment by week interaction as ﬁxed effects; patient and error as random effects; and an unstructured variance/covariance matrix.All scheduled postbaseline measurements were included, with no imputation of missing data. Least-squares (LS) estimates and CIs of the treatment differences be-tween EQW and the three oral comparators were presented. The differences were based
