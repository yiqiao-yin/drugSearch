dardized meal tolerance test, baselinedata at week 0 (all arms received placebo)showed a similar rise in postprandialplasma glucose concentrations acrosstreatment arms (Fig. 3 A). Geometric mean area under the curve 15–180 minvalues at baseline were similar. At week 4,postprandial plasma glucose concentra-tions were reduced in both exenatidearms compared with placebo ( P/H11005 0.006). Postprandial plasma glucose geo-metric mean area under the curve 15–180min values averaged 34% lower thanbaseline in each exenatide arm, comparedwith only 9% lower than baseline in theplacebo arm. This pattern was sustainedto week 30 with a robust lowering of post-prandial glucose concentrations in the10-/H9262g(P/H110050.004) and 5- /H9262g exenatide arms ( P/H110050.03; Fig. 3 B). At week 30, there was a rise in plasma insulin in re-sponse to the meal in all three arms, witha greater early increment noted in the10-/H9262g exenatide arm compared with pla-
