ation for the Study of Diabetes treatment algorithm pub-lished in 2009 cites glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) re-ceptor agonists as a less-validated but potential add-ontherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes if glycemiccontrol is not achieved after lifestyle intervention and met-formin therapy (4). In addition, the 2009 consensus algo-rithm created by the American Association of ClinicalEndocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocri-nology (ACE) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes supportscombination therapy for patients who require advancedtreatment. Although metformin is recommended formonotherapy and as a component of combination antidia-betes therapies, GLP-1 receptor agonists are positioned aspreferred secondary agents because of their efficacy andoverall safety profile, notably glucose-dependent stimula-tion of insulin secretion and the resultant low risk of hy-poglycemia, ability to produce weight loss, and postpran-dial glucose-lowering characteristics (5).
