Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, improves gly-cemic control in patients with type 2 dia-betes through multiple mechanisms ofaction: increased glucose-dependent in-sulin secretion, attenuated postprandialglucagon secretion, slowed gastric empty-ing, and increased satiety (7,8). Thetwice-daily formulation of exenatide (ex-enatide BID) improves both fasting andpostprandial glucose control, resulting inA1C reductions of roughly 0.8–1.0% inplacebo-controlled trials (9–12) and 1.0–1.4% in open-label trials (13–15). Theseimprovements in glucose control weremaintained in patients completing 3 yearsof treatment ( /H110021.0%) (16). Exenatide
