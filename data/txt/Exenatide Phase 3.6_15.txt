Analyses were by intention to treat, which included all  randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug. We used SAS (version 9.1) to produce the analyses. Statistical methods were documented before database lock in a statistical analysis plan. With the assumption of a 0·25% (3 mmol/mol) treatment diﬀ  er- ence in change in HbA 1c, a common SD of 1·1%  (12 mmol/mol), and a 10% dropout rate before week 8, 907 patients were planned to be randomly assigned to provide 90% power for superiority of exenatide. For analyses of continuous variables with several post- baseline measurements, we used a maximum likeli hood-based mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with eﬀ  ects for treatment, baseline of the variable measured, HbA 1c stratum, country, stratum of oral anti- hyperglycaemic drugs, week of visit, and treatment-by-week interaction as ﬁ  xed eﬀ  ects, and patient as a random  eﬀ ect. Data obtained at the early termination visits were
