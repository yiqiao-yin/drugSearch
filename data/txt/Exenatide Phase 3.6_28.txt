discontinued because of treatment-emergent adverse events compared with 12 (3%) in the exenatide group (table 3). Injection-site nodules were more common with exenatide than with liraglutide (table 3). We noted more serious adverse events in the exenatide group than in the liraglutide group, with no identiﬁ  able pattern of  events (table 3). Four patients (two in each group) died: three of the four patients died after they had completed the 26 week treatment period (suicide, cerebrovascular accident, and pulmonary embolism), and one died (sudden death) about 10 weeks after discontinuation for a protocol violation. Routinely measured concentrations of pancreatic lipase  and total amylase varied in both groups and were not predictive of gastrointestinal symptoms (data not shown).  –5·0–4·0–3·0–2·0–1·00Least-squares mean change in bodyweight (kg)* * * * ** † ‡ 02468 1 0 1 2 1 4 Time (weeks)16 18 20 22 24 26Exenatide once weekly (n=461) Liraglutide once daily (n=450)
