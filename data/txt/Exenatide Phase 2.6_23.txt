1cvalues /H110227%, 46% (39 subjects) in the 10- /H9262g ex- enatide arm and 32% (25 subjects) in the5-/H9262g exenatide arm achieved an HbA 1c /H113497% by week 30. These proportions of the evaluable population were signiÔ¨Å-cantly greater than in the placebo arm(13% [10 subjects]; P/H110210.0001 and P/H11021 0.01, respectively) (Fig. 2 B). Fasting plasma glucose concentra- tions were equivalent among treatmentarms at baseline (Fig. 1). At week 30, fast-ing plasma glucose concentrations were /H110020.6/H110060.2 mmol/l ( /H1100210.1/H110064.4 mg/dl; P/H110050.0001) and /H110020.4/H110060.3 mmol/l (/H110027.2/H110064.6 mg/dl; P/H110210.005) for the 10- and 5- /H9262g exenatide arms, respec- tively, compared with /H110010.8/H110060.2 mmol/l (/H1100114.4/H110064.2 mg/dl) for the placebo arm. The end of study difference from placeboaveraged /H110021.4 mmol/l ( /H1100225 mg/dl) in the 10-/H9262g exenatide arm ( P/H110050.0001). In subjects who underwent a stan-
