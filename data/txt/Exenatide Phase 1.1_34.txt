postprandially with the same kineticsas after administration of placebo.Nevertheless, postprandial plasmainsulin levels increased more rapidlyin the exenatide treatment groups(doses of  ≥0.1 µg/kg) than in the pla- cebo group and tended to remainabove baseline for the remainder ofthe eight-hour observation period,hours after the placebo group’s insu-lin level had returned to baseline.This continued elevation in insulinconcentrations in the face of low-ered, albeit still elevated, ambientglucose concentrations is consistentwith the glucose-dependent insulin-otropic action of exenatide previous-ly observed in other clinical studies. 28 Exenatide also suppressed postpran-dial plasma glucagon concentrationsstarting at 20 minutes postdose andextending to the end of the three-hourobservation period. These data con-firm the data reported by Kolterman etal., 28 who found that exenatide re-
