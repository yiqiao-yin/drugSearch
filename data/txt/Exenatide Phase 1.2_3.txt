that leads to inadequate insulin secretion (1). The currentapproach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes is generallystepwise and systematic. Early treatment may consist of dietmanagement, exercise, and weight control. As glucose con-trol deteriorates, pharmacological therapy is initiated withone or two oral antidiabetic agents (OAAs), and later, anadditional OAA or insulin may be added. Ultimately, manyif not most individuals with type 2 diabetes require insulinas primary therapy with OAA adjunctive therapy often nec-essary to achieve targeted glycemic goals. Despite the introduction of a number of novel agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, glucose control in this pop-ulation remains unsatisfactory because average hemoglobinA 1c(HbA1c) values well above 8% are reported in many epidemiologic studies (2). Moreover, many therapies have
