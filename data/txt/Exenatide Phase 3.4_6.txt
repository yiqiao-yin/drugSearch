RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Outcomes The aim of this study was to assess the efﬁcacy of EQW compared with MET, PIO, and SITA, as measured by change in HbA 1c after 26 weeks. Secondary and exploratory measures included the proportion of pa- tients achieving HbA 1c,7.0 and #6.5%, changes in fasting serum glucose, seven- point self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), weight, serum lipids, homeostasismodel assessment of pancreatic b-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S), and safety and tolerability. Patient-reported outcomes were collected,including Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lite (IWQOL-Lite), Binge Eating Scale (BES), the Diabetes Treat-ment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ), and EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D). Safety end points were adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs,hypoglycemia, and antibodies to exenatide. Treatment-emergent adverse events were deﬁned as those occurring or worsening
