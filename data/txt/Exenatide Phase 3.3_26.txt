96 (43%) of 223 given glargine. Baseline characteristics of participants who did and did not achieve HbA 1c control did  not seem to diﬀ  er (appendix). At week 156, mean HbA1c  was 6·5% (SD 0·6; 48 mmol/mol, SD 6·6) in individuals who achieved control in the exenatide group versus 6·6% (0·4; 49 mmol/mol, 4·4) in the glargine group, and 7·8% (0·9; 62 mmol/mol, 9·8) in non-achievers in the exenatide group versus 7·9% (1·0; 63 mmol/mol, 9·8) in the glargine group. For patients who achieved sustained control, least-squares mean reduction in HbA 1c by week 156 was –1·32%  (SE 0·07; –14·4 mmol/mol, 0·8) in the exenatide group versus –1·17% (0·08; –12·8 mmol/mol, 0·9) in the glargine group (p=0·12; ﬁ  gure 3A). At week 156, mean FSG was 6·68 mmol/L (SD 2·03) in goal achievers in the
