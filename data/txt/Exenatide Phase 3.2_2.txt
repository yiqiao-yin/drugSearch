from pioglitazone to exenatide once-weekly maintained HbA 1cand fasting plasma glucose improvements (week 52: )1.6/C60.1%, )1.7/C60.3 mmol ⁄l), with signiﬁcant weight reduction ( )3.0/C60.3 kg). Exenatide once-weekly was generally well tolerated and adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity. Nausea was the most frequent adverse eventin this assessment period (intent-to-treat: ex enatide once-weekly-only 5%; sitagliptin ﬁexenatide once-weekly 11%; pioglitazone ﬁexenatide once-weekly 10%). No major hypoglycaemia was observed. Conclusions Patients who switched to once-weekly exenatide from daily sitagliptin or pioglitazone had improved or sustained glycaemic control, with weight loss.
