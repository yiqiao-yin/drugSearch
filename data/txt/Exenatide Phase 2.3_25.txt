nausea was generally mild or moderate in intensity and peaked during the initialweeks of dosing (weeks 0â€“8), then de-creased in incidence thereafter (Fig. 4). Incontrast, weight loss was progressive over30 weeks, and subjects who never re-ported nausea also lost weight (Table 2).The incidence of severe nausea was low(5% in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm, 6% in the 5-/H9262g exenatide arm, and 2% in pla- cebo arm). Withdrawals due to nauseawere also low (4% in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm, 2% in the 5- /H9262g exenatide arm, and 0% in placebo arm). There were no cases of severe hypo- glycemia. The overall incidence of mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia was 36% inthe 10- /H9262g exenatide arm, 14% in the 5-/H9262g exenatide arm, and 3% in the pla- cebo arm. Only one subject withdrew dueto hypoglycemia (5- /H9262g exenatide arm). The incidence of treatment-emergent,dose-dependent hypoglycemia peakedduring the initial weeks of dosing, thendecreased over time.
