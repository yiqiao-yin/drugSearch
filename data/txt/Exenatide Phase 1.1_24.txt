1.4 to 1.8 hours, with no significantdifference between treatmentgroups. Gastric emptying.  There was a dose-dependent slowing of gastricemptying in study B, assessed by de-creased mean acetaminophen con-centrations (Figure 3C). Mean plasmaacetaminophen AUC 0–120 min pairwise comparisons were significant for the0.05- µg/kg exenatide group (907 µg • min/mL) versus placebo (1288 µg • min/mL) ( p = 0.0329) and the 0.1 µg/kg exenatide group (645 µg • min/ mL) versus placebo ( p = 0.0011). The exenatide groups had mean plas-ma acetaminophen values of 13.8,11.4, and 7.7  µg/mL for 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1 µg/kg exenatide, respectively, compared with 15.6 µg/mL for the placebo group. Mean Cmax pairwise comparisons of acetaminophen weresignificant for 0.05  µg/kg exenatide versus placebo ( p = 0.0155) and 0.1 µg/kg exenatide versus placebo (p = 0.0001). Safety. In study A, a greater fre- quency of treatment-emergent ad-verse events was reported in the 0.3-and 0.4- µg/kg exenatide groups than
