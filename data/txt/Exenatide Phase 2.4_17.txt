Kaplan–Meier estimates on Day 43 (the day after the last-dose day for the last subject) were 0.68 for theexenatide-naive arm and 0.28 for the exenatide-primed arm ( p≤0.001). Because the study design allowed a ±1- day window for each visit, and because patients often did not adhere to the protocol’s visit structure, there was some variation in the actual day the subjects inthe exenatide-naive arm received the initial 0 .24µg/kg exenatide dose, as well as some variation in the exenatide- primed arm (dosage factor). This variation resulted ina pronounced ‘stepping’ pattern in the proportion of subjects experiencing nausea and vomiting between Days 31 and 36. Figure 1B shows the Kaplan–Meier plot for the proportion of subjects experiencing nausea and vomiting, corrected for this dosage factor. The stepping patternwas reduced (prior to receiving exenatide); however, a small but discernable ste pping pattern remained after correction for the dosage factor. The remaining stepping
