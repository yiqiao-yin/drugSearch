For this second phase of the study, glu-cose control during the transition fromexenatide BID to exenatide QW was ex-amined, as well as the safety, tolerability,and efÔ¨Åcacy of 52 weeks of exenatide QWtreatment. Plasma analytes and A1C werequantitated by Quintiles Laboratories(Smyrna, GA) using standard methods.A1C was measured using high-perfor-mance liquid chromatography. Plasmaantibodies to exenatide were measured byMillipore Corporation Drug Discovery(St. Charles, MO) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (20). Titersof antibodies to exenatide were deter-mined by serial 1:5 dilutions after an ini-tial dilution of 1:25 (also expressed as thereciprocal of the highest dilution of sam-ple serum that tests positive in the assay).Blood pressure was measured after /H110115 min of quiet rest in a sitting position, re-peated after at least 30 s, and the two mea-surements were averaged.
