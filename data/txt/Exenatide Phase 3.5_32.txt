were above the upper limit of the normal range in 5 and 14%of subjects, respectively, before treatment. During the courseof the study, there was substantial variability in pancreatic-amylase and lipase concentrations. The incidence of adverse events, including gastrointestinal symptoms, was similar be-tween subjects with normal and abnormal postbaseline am-ylase and lipase measured at any postbaseline time point. A statistically significant increase in heart rate was ob- served [LS mean change (95% CI) from baseline of /H110014.1 (2.5, 5.6) beats per minute [bpm] in ExQW and /H110012.1 (0.4, 3.7) bpm in ExBID], which was not associated with cardio-vascular or arrhythmia-related adverse events. Approxi-mately 73% ExQW and 51% ExBID patients were positivefor treatment-emergent antibodies to exenatide at any timepoint during the study. There was no apparent association ofantibody status on the overall incidence of adverse events. There were no events of thyroid neoplasms reported dur-
