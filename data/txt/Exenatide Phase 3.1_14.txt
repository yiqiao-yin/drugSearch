Minor hypoglycemia was de- ﬁned as a report of symptoms consistentwith hypoglycemia and a glucose value of/H1102154 mg/dl before treatment of the episode. RESULTSPatient disposition and baseline characteristicsOf the 295 ITT patients, 258 patients(87%) continued into the second phase ofthe trial (Fig. 1). Demographics and back-ground therapy were similar between thetwo 52-week evaluable cohorts. Overall,243 patients completed 52 weeks of treat-ment, representing 82% of the originalITT population and 94% of the popula-tion entering the second predeﬁned treat-ment period. Efﬁcacy of exenatide QW During this 22-week assessment period,patients who continued exenatide QWtreatment maintained improvements inA1C (Fig. 2 A), with a least squares mean (95% CI) change from baseline A1C of/H110022.1% (/H110022.2 to/H110021.9%) at week 30 and /H110022.0% (/H110022.1 to/H110021.8%) at week 52.
