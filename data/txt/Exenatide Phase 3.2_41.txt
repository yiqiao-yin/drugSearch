markers were not signiﬁcantly changed from original baseline; the urinary albumin ⁄creatinine ratio signi ﬁcantly improved from original baseline. It should be noted that the low mean baselinevalues of these markers make clinical interpretations difﬁcult.Although the mechanism responsible for these improvementscannot be elucidated from this study, it has been demonstratedthat improvements in microalbuminuria are associated withimprovements in systolic blood pressure and HbA 1c[11]; B-type natriuretic peptide is also inter related with renal and vascular function [12]. The differenti al effects by which exenatide increased high-sensitivity C-rea ctive protein to original baseline values in pioglitazone-treated pat ients, but was associated with
