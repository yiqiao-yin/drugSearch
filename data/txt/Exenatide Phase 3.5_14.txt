A sample size of approximately 250 patients (ratio of 1:1) was estimated to provide 90% power to demonstrate that ExQW wasnoninferior to ExBID by a 0.4% difference in the HbA1c changefrom baseline to wk 24, using a one-sided, two-sample ttest with a significance level of 0.025 and assuming a greater (0.1%) re-duction in HbA1c by ExQW compared with ExBID, a 15%withdrawal rate, and a common SDof 1.1%.
