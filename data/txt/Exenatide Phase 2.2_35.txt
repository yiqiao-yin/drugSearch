niﬁcant improvement in glycemic in-dexes over 28 days in patients notpreviously achieving glycemic controlwith metformin and/or sulfonylurea treat-ment is remarkable, as the magnitude ofimprovement is difﬁcult to achieve withthe simple addition of a second or thirdoral agent (33). Moreover, while insulintherapy can be used to achieve this out-come, a vast literature documents thatthis approach is generally associated withsigniﬁcant weight gain (4), increased hy-poglycemia (4), and attendant morbidi-ties (34). Interestingly, AC2993 treatmentwas associated with no weight gain in theface of improved glycemic control. Con-sistent with this observation, exendin-4has been reported to acutely reduce foodintake in healthy human subjects (35)and cause weight loss in animal models ofobesity (9).HOMA analysis revealed improved /H9252-cell secretory function following
