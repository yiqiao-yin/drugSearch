phosphate solution. The reaction wasstopped using 0.1 mol/l sodium phos-phate/1.5 mol/l sodium chloride. Measurement of anti-AC2993 anti- bodies was performed using a solid-phaseenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Brieﬂy, AC2993 (5 /H9262g/ml in 0.05 mol/l carbonate buffer, pH 9.5) was added towells of microtiter plates, except for con-trol wells coated with anti-human Ig (10/H9262g/ml in the same buffer). The plates were incubated for 1–3 days at 4°C, thenincubated with MegaBloc3 (1:500; CellAssociates, The Sea Ranch, CA) fo r1ha t room temperature. Samples were addedand incubated for 1 h. Between incu-bation steps, wells were washed with PBS/0.1% Tween-20. Anti-human Ig/horseradish peroxidase was added andthe mixture was incubated for 1 h. Theassay was then developed using O- phenylenediamine (Sigma, St. Louis,MO) in citrate buffer (0.055 mol/l phos-phate/0.024 mol/l citrate, pH 5.0). Thereaction was stopped by 4N sulfuric acid.Absorbance was read at 490 nm.
