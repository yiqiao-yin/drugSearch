Patients in all treatment groups had mean improvements from baseline inperceived treatment satisfaction, weight- related quality of life, and binge-eating behavior (Supplementary Tables 4 –9). All treatments with the exception of PIO were associated with signi ﬁcant mean im- provements in health status. Signi ﬁcant improvements in weight-related quality of life, binge-eating behavior, and health status were reported for patients treatedwith EQW compared with PIO. CONCLUSIONS dHead-to-head com- parative studies are needed to better informtreatment decisions for type 2 diabetes (1), a disease for which there are numeroustreatment options. This study evaluated the efﬁcacy and safety of EQW monotherapy, in comparison with MET, PIO, and SITAmonotherapy, in drug-naive patients withtype 2 diabetes. Treatment with EQW, MET, and PIO all resulted in improve- ments in glycemic control, achievingmean HbA
