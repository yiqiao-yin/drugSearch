calculated that 60 patients per treatment group would  provide >90% power to detect a difference between  exenatide 10 pg and placebo and 77% power to de-  tect a difference between exenatide 5 pg and placebo  using the Fisher Protected Testing procedure, s°  The primary efficacy analysis was performed using  a last-observation-carried-forward approach with an  analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). sl The ANCOVA  model included effects for treatment, screening HbAI~  subgroup, and HbAlc baseline values. Multiplicity of  adjustments for change in HbAI~ was performed using  the Fisher Protected Testing procedure, s° Least-squares  (LS) means were produced from the model to estimate  the magnitude of treatment effects. Pairwise compari-  sons between each exenatide group and placebo were  based on t tests for treatment differences using the LS  means (SE) obtained using the ANCOVA model, sl  To assess change in efficacy over time, a likelihood-
