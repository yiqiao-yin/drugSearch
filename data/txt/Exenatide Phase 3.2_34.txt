No cases ofpancreatitis were reported in thi s 26-week open-label treatment period and no cases were reported i n patients receiving exenatide once-weekly during the ﬁrst 26 weeks of the study [3]. No episodes of major hypoglycaemia occurred; minorhypoglycaemia incidence was low [ n= 5 (1%)] and was similar among cohorts (exenatide once-weekly-only: 1%;sitagliptin ﬁexenatide once-weekly: 2%; pioglitazone ﬁ exenatide once-weekly: 1%). Discussion Glycaemic control and body weight Exenatide once-weekly elicits continuous exposure totherapeutic concentrations of the GLP-1 receptor agonist,exenatide, which acts to increase glucose-dependent insulinsection, decrease inappropria te elevations in postprandial
