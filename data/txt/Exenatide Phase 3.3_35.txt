tested positive for anti-exenatide antibodies decreased from 113 (56%) of 202 for whom data were available  at  26 weeks to 26 (19%) of 139 at 3 years (ﬁ  gure 5A). The  overall proportion of patients reporting one or more treatment-related adverse events was similar in participants with a high titre of these antibodies (12 [80%] of 15), those with a low titre of antibodies (42 [84%] of 50), and individuals who tested negative for the antibodies (133 [83%] of 161) at treatment endpoint. H owever,  injection-site reactions were more common in patients with low (12 [24%] of 50) and high (three [20%] of 15) titres of antibodies than in antibody-negative patients (13 [8%] of 161). Patients in the exenatide group who tested negative for  anti-exenatide antibodies or had low antibody titres at week 156 had more consistent reductions in HbA 1c over  time than those with high antibody titres at week 156 (ﬁ gure 5B). The 3-year least-squares mean change in  HbA
