well-established methods. Plasmaacetaminophen was measured byQuest Diagnostics or MDS PharmaServices (Lincoln, NE) with a high-performance liquid chro matography assay. Quantitation of exenatide wasconducted by Amylin Pharmaceuticalswith an immunoenzymetric assay. 23 Statistical analyses.  In study A, all patients who received exenatide wereincluded in the analysis. In study B,evaluable patients were defined asthose who received at least two dosesand had sufficient data to allow reli-able evaluation of the pharmacody-namic parameters. The area underthe concentration–time curve(AUC 0–t) was calculated from con- centration profiles and logarithmi-cally transformed (base e) before analysis. Baseline-adjusted data wereanalyzed without logarithmic trans-formation for pharmacodynamic pa-rameters relative to the time of doseadministration. Pharmacodynamicanalyses were performed using ananalysis of variance (ANOVA) or amixed-effect model 24 that included terms for sequence, p eriod, and
