Changes in weight (kg) at  24 weeks were greater with exenatide 5 and 10 pg  than placebo (-2.8 [0.3] and -3.1 [0.3] vs -1.4 [0.3];  P = 0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively). HOMA-B  values increased from baseline to end point by 32%  and 28% in the exenatide 5- and 10-pg groups, re-  spectively, versus 6% for placebo. Improvements from  baseline to end point in HOMA-B were significantly  greater with exenatide 5 and 10 pg than placebo (P =  0.002 and P = 0.010, respectively). Significant im-  provements in mean systolic and diastolic blood pres-  sure (mm Hg) from baseline to end point were also  observed with exenatide (systolic, both 5 and 10 pg,  These data were presented in part at the 68th Scientific Sessions of the  American Diabetes Association,June (5-10, 2008, San Francisco, Calif.
