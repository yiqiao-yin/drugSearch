4.5% (ﬁve subjects) in the 5- /H9262g exenatidearm, and 5.3% (six subjects) in the pla- cebo arm. The incidence of anti-exenatideantibodies (43% at 30 weeks) had no pre-dictive effect on glycemic control or ad-verse events. Most treatment-emergentanti-exenatide antibodies were low titer(1/125) and of unknown biologicalrelevance. CONCLUSIONS — The data demon- strate that when exenatide at doses of 5and 10 /H9262g twice daily is added to a back- ground of metformin for 30 weeks in agroup of type 2 diabetic patients with less-than-optimal glycemic control (baselineHbA 1c/H110118.2%), there was an overall im - provement in glycemia (end of studyHbA1c/H110117.4%), with nearly 50% of pa - tients able to reach an HbA1ctreatment goal of/H113497% when treated with the 10- /H9262g dose. The magnitude of HbA1creduction was notable, as the baseline HbA1cwas relatively low (8.2%). Many previous tri- als in this disease population have studiedpatients with higher baseline HbA 1clev-
