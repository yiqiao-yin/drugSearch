than 5 –6% [/H110023.3 to 5.8 pg/ml ( /H110023.3 to 5.8 ng/liter) on d 5]. Consistent with these findings, the glucagon AUC(0–180min) was significantly lower o n d 5 following 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993 treatment, compared with placebo ( P/H110050.0123). Results were similar o nd1a n dd5 . Postprandial plasma acetaminophen (gastric emptying). The in- crease in mean postprandial plasma acetaminophen concen-tration was reduced following treatment with 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993, compared with placebo (Table 2), consistent withslowed gastric emptying. The difference in acetaminophenAUC (0–300min) was statistically significant ( P/H110210.0001). Re - sults were similar o nd1a n dd5 .
