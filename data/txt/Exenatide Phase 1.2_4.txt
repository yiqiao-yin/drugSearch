limiting side effects such as weight gain, hypoglycemia, andedema, and have restrictions for use (3). Results from theUnited Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) in-dicate that /H9252-cell failure is progressive and relentless (4) despite therapy with insulin, sulfonylurea, or biguanideagents (5). In contrast, insulin resistance does not appear toprogress in parallel with /H9252-cell failure (6). Consistent withthis finding, an increasing proportion of subjects in the UKPDS who were treated originally with diet managementor OAAs eventually required insulin therapy for glucosecontrol (7). No currently available therapy has been shownto slow the decline in /H9252-cell function in established type 2 diabetes. Taken together, these data suggest that ideal ther-apies for the long-term treatment of type 2 diabetes areneeded to delay, arrest, or reverse declining /H9252-cell function
