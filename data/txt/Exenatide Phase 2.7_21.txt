Sig-  nificant differences in HbAI~ change from baseline  were observed in both exenatide groups versus place-  bo at 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks (all, P < 0.001). At end  point, the changes from baseline HbAI~ were -0.7%  (0.1%) in the exenatide 5-pg group (P = 0.003) and  -0.9% (0.1%) in the exenatide 10-pg group (P <  0.001 ), compared with -0.2 % (0.1% ) with placebo. A  significant linear dose effect (P = 0.024) was observed,  indicating progressive improvement in HbAI~ with in-  creased dose.  Of patients who had an HbAI~ value >6.5% at  baseline, 31% (23/74; P = NS) and 35% (24/69; P =  0.026) patients in the exenatide 5- and 10-pg groups,  respectively, achieved an HbAlc value <6.5% at end  point, compared with 19% (14/74) of patients who  received placebo (Figure 3A).
