a sulfonylurea and/or metformin were enrolled in a blinded study. Patients were randomlyassigned to one of three subcutaneously (SC) injected regimens of AC2993 (0.08 /H9262g/kg) or placebo for 28 days. RESULTS — All three AC2993 regimens led to signiﬁcant reductions in serum fructosamine relative to placebo ( P/H113490.004). Mean reductions ranged from 39 to 46 /H9262mol/l. All AC2993 groups had reductions in HbA 1cranging from 0.7 to 1.1% ( P/H113490.006). An end-of-study HbA1c /H110217% was achieved by 15% of AC2993 patients versus 4% of placebo patients, conﬁrming AC2993 effects on fasting and postprandial glycemia. On days 14 and 28, the /H9252-cell index (homeostasis model assessment) for patients treated with AC2993 was 50–100% higher thanbaseline, contrasting with unchanged levels for placebo. The most common adverse event wastransient mild-to-moderate nausea. CONCLUSIONS — AC2993 is a promising therapeutic for patients with type 2 diabetes. In
