28 Meal-entrained endoge- nous enteropancreatic hormones,such as cholecystokinin, amylin, andGLP-1, slow gastric emptying, at-testing to the importance of thisfunction for overall control of nu-trient assimilation. 32 Delivery of nutrients from the stomach to thesmall intestine is the rate-limitingstep for glucose absorption fromthe gastrointestinal tract and, thus, is a critical determinant of post-prandial glucose excursion. 33 In- deed, patients who have undergonegastrectomy exhibit postprandialhyperglycemia despite apparentlynormal  β-cell function that pro- duces significant postprandial hy-perinsulinemia. 34 Whether gastric- emptying rates are slow, normal, oraccelerated in patients with diabeteswithout severe autonomic neuropa-thy is controversial. 18 One of the main confounders in understandingthe pathophysiology of gastric emp-tying in diabetes is hyperglycemia it-self, as elevated glucose concentrationsin nondiabetics slow the gastric-emptying rate. 35 Thus, a “normal”
