glucagon, increase satiety and slow gastric emptying [5]. Thecontinuous exenatide exposure achieved with exenatide once- weekly has been shown to result in a signiﬁcantly greater fasting plasma glucose and HbA 1creduction, with similar weight reduction, compared with the twice daily exenatideformulation [6]. In the current study, patients who continuedexenatide once-weekly treatment for a total of 52 weeksmaintained the improvements in HbA 1cand fasting plasma glucose observed during the ﬁrst 26 weeks of treatment (52-weekimprovements: )1.6% and )1.8 mmol ⁄l) and exhibited a signiﬁcant improvement from or iginal baseline in body weight ()1.8 kg). Similar 52-week improvements in HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose and weight have pr eviously been demonstrated [7]. DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g. sitagliptin) and GLP-1 receptor agonists
