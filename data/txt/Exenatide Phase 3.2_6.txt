patients continued metformin background therapy, and patientsand investigators remained blinded to original treatment. Thistrial was designed to evaluate the glycaemic and non-glycaemic(body weight, blood pressure , fasting lipids, markers of cardiovascular risk) changes i n patients: (i ) treated with exenatide once-weekly for 52 weeks; (ii) who switched fromdaily inhibition of DPP-4 (which elicits an approximately twofold increase in circulating postprandial GLP-1 [4]) to a therapy that results in continuous exposure to greaterconcentrations of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide; and(iii) who switched from daily per oxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR- c) stimulation with pioglitazone, which increases insulin sensitivity, but is also often associated withincreased body weight, to a therapy that augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion and is associated with weight loss.
