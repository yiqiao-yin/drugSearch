weight after 26 weeks, whereas SITA ledto a lesser reduction. Although variability based on study design and patient charac- teristics was expected, weight reductionobserved in this study with EQW was on the lower end of the range ( 22.0 to23.7 k g )o b s e r v e di np r e v i o u sD U R A T I O Nstudies (6,7,10,17). Conversely, reduc-t i o n so b s e r v e dw i t hS I T Aa n dM E Ti n the current study tended to be greater than results from meta-analyses and recentmonotherapy trials of similar duration (5,18 –20). The potential for improve- ments in HbA 1cand body weight in stud- ies with placebo injection therapy has been noted in a previous study of exenatide therapy (21). These data show that EQWand MET provided the best pro ﬁle in terms of improving glycemic control as well as reducing weight, without increasedrisk of hypoglycemia, particularly impor-tant for treatment of overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
