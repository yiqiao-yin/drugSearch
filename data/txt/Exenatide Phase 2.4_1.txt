designed to formally assess the possibility of inducing tolerance to the sideeffects of nausea and vomiting at therapeutic doses of exenatide, using adose-escalation methodology. Methods In this two-arm, triple-blind, multicenter study, 123 subjects with type 2 diabetes were enrolled and randomized; 99 (80.5%) of them completed the study. Subjects in the exenatide-primed arm received subcutaneous exenatide, starting at 0 .02µg/kg three times a day (TID) and increasing in 0.02µg/kg per dose increments every 3 days for 35 days. Subjects in the exenatide-naive arm received placebo TID for 35 days. At the end of this 35-day regimen, subjects in both arms received the same highest dose of exenatide (0 .24µg/kg TID) for 3 days. Thus, the exenatide-naive arm received exenatide for the ﬁrst time on Day 35. Results The exenatide-primed arm had a lower proportion of subjects
