A strong dose dependency for the HbA 1cre- duction was evident as the average HbA 1cre- duction at Day 28 was approximately doublein the 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. group compared with the 2.5 /H9262g b.i.d. group. Interestingly, dose depen- dency was not observed for FPG. The lack ofdose dependency might be partially explainedby the higher baseline FPG values in the 2.5 and5.0 /H9262g b.i.d. groups relative to the placebo and the 7.5 and 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. groups, especially in light of the glucose dependency of exenatideâ€™sinsulinotropic effects, as well as the tendencyof FPG measures to be somewhat variable over time and the fact that exenatide has itsstrongest glucose-lowering effects in the post-prandial period. 13Additionally, the reductions in body weight were approximately three timesgreater in the 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. group compared with the 2.5 /H9262g b.i.d. group.
