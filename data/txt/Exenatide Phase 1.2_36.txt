AC2993 is best illustrated by the data obtained in the fastingstate (Fig. 5B). These data show a dose-dependent effect ofAC2993 on enhancing glucose-dependent insulinotropismwhile the prevailing glucose concentration is elevated (first3 h) and a gradual fall in insulin secretion with reestablish-ment of near basal insulinemia when the prevailing glucoseconcentration decreases to the near normal range (beyondthe first 3 h). Since AC2993 concentrations remained elevatedthroughout the course of the assessment consistent with thelong circulating half-life of AC2993 (39), the reduction ininsulin beyon d 3 h does not reflect a simple loss of AC2993
