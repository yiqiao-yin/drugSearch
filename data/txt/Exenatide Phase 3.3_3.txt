32 [14%] vs 15 [7%]), although frequency of these events did decrease after week 26 in the exenatide group. The proportion of patients who reported serious adverse events in the exenatide group (36 patients [15%]) was the same as that in the glargine group (33 [15%]). The exposure-adjusted rate of overall hypoglycaemia was three times higher in patients given glargine (0·9 events per patient per year) than in those given exenatide (0·3 events per patient per year). Interpretation Eﬃ   cacy of once-weekly exenatide is sustained for 3 years.
