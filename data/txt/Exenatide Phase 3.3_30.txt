Bodyweight decreased with exenatide and increased  with glargine (ﬁ   gure 2D). At 156 weeks, least-squares  mean bodyweight change was –2·49 kg (SE 0·28) in patients given exenatide and 2·01 kg (0·28) in those given glargine (least-squares mean diﬀ  erence –4·51 kg, SE 0∙37,  95% CI–5·23 to –3·79; p<0·001). Bodyweight changes were similar in completer analyses: least-squares mean bodyweight change was –2·69 kg (SE 0·40) in patients given exenatide and 1·99 kg (0·40) in those given glargine (least-squares mean diﬀ  erence –4·69 kg, SE 0·56, 95% CI  –5·78 to –3·59; p<0·001). Both groups had beneﬁ  cial  changes in 1,5-anhydroglucitol and C-reactive protein that were greater in the exenatide group than in the glargine group (table 2). Additionally, the exenatide group had mean reductions in waist and hip circumference, whereas the glargine group had mean increases in these measures. We recorded no other notable diﬀ  erences in changes in  cardiovascular and metabolic measures (table 2).
