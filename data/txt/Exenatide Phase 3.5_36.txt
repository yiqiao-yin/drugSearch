Fewer gastrointestinal adverse events were observed with ExQWtherapycomparedwithExBID.Theseresultsarecon-sistent with the results of DURATION-1 and with observa-tions that a gradual increase in plasma exenatide concentra-tions may decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal adverseevents (16, 30). Treatment with ExQW has been shown togenerate steady-state plasma exenatide concentrationswithin approximately 6â€“10 wk (15, 16). In the current study,improvements in glycemic control were observed with ExQW as early as the first postbaseline measurement (4 wkafter first dose) and in a time frame comparable with that ofExBID, suggesting that the gradual rise in plasma exenatideconcentrations, although enhancing tolerability, does notsubstantially delay improvements in glycemic control.
