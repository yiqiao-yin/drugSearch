Plasma exenatide concentrations in-creased in a dose-dependent mannerafter single s.c. doses in studies A andB. In study A, plasma exenatide con-centrations appeared to exhibit dose-proportional kinetics, reaching peakconcentrations between 2 and3 hours, and were still detectable15 hours postdose with doses of0.2  µg/kg and higher (Figure 1A). For the 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.3-, and 0.4- µg/kg ex- enatide doses, the correspondinggeometric mean AUC 0–15 hr values were 55,562, 104,225, 144,335, and205,193 pg  • min/mL, respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstratedsignificantly greater AUC 0–15 hr values for the 0.4- µg/kg group compared with all other treatment groups ( p ≤ 0.02), and plasma exenatide concen- trations in all exenatide groups weresignificantly greater than those in theplacebo group at all times measuredafter exenatide administration ( p < 0.0001). In study B, there was clear differ-
