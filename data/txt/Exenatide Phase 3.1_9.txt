Randomization and interventions Patients were randomly assigned to one oftwo open-label treatment groups: weeklysubcutaneous injections of 2 mg ex-enatide QW or 5 /H9262g exenatide BID for the Ô¨Årst 28 days followed by a required doseincrease to 10 /H9262g BID for the remainder of the 30-week assessment period. The in-clusion and exclusion criteria and resultsfrom the initial 30 weeks have been re-ported previously (17). At 30 weeks, par-ticipants entered a second, open-endedtreatment period in which all patients re-ceived exenatide QW. Patients whoswitched from exenatide BID to exenatideQW treatment and were concomitantlyusing a sulfonylurea (SFU) were requiredto reduce their SFU dose to the minimumrecommended dose until week 40. Sub-sequently, the SFU dose was up-titratedbased on daily glucose measurements toreach a target fasting plasma glucose(FPG) of /H11349110 mg/dl. Patients originally randomly assigned to exenatide QWmaintained their treatment regimen.
