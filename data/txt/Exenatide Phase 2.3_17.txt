Forthe ITT population at week 30 with base-line HbA 1c/H110227% ( n/H11005353), 41 subjects (34.2%) in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm and 31 subjects (26.7%) in the 5- /H9262g exenatide arm reached an HbA1c/H113497%, and these proportions of the population were signif- icantly greater than in the placebo arm (9subjects [7.7%]; P/H110210.0001 for pairwise comparisons). For the evaluable popula-tion at week 30 with baseline HbA 1c/H110227% (n/H11005237), 33 subjects (41.3%) in the 10-/H9262g exenatide arm and 28 subjects (32.6%) in the 5- /H9262g exenatide arm reached an HbA1c/H113497%, and these pro - portions of the evaluable population weresigniﬁcantly greater than in the placeboarm (6 subjects [8.8%]; P/H113490.0002 for pairwise comparisons). When stratiﬁed by baseline HbA 1c /H113509%, the 10- and 5- /H9262g exenatide arms had changes in HbA1cfrom baseline of
