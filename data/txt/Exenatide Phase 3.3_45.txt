factors were associated with sustained, similar improve-ments from baseline in both treatment groups, consistent with the 26-week results. 4 Similar improvements were also  reported in a previous long-term, but uncontrolled, study extension of exenatide given once weekly. 22,24 Overall, adverse events were consistent with those  reported during the 26-week core treatment period4 and  with previous long-term data.22,24 Acute pancreatitis was  rare, and no patients reported major hypoglycaemia resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure. Minor hypoglycaemia was most common in patients given glargine and concomitant sulfonylureas. Patients given exenatide could achieve lower HbA 1c values with a  decreased risk of hypoglycaemia than could patients given glargine. In the analysis by sustained HbA 1c goal  achievement, hypoglycaemia risk remained decreased in patients given exenatide, but was also lower in individuals  in the glargine group who had not achieved HbA 1c
