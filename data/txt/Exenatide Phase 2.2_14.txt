Quantitation of plasma glucose, fructosamine, insulin, HbA1c, lipids, and cortisol was performed by Esoterix Laboratory (Calabasas Hills, CA) ac-cording to well-established methods.Quantitation of AC2993 and anti-AC2993 antibodies was done by AmylinPharmaceuticals, Inc. (San Diego, CA).Glucose was measured using the RocheGlucose/HK Reagent Set (Roche Diag-nostics, Indianapolis, IN) for glucoseanalysis. Fructosamine was measuredusing a colorimetric assay (21). Insulinwas measured using a two-site immuno-chemiluminometric assay. Total hemo-globin and HbA 1cwere measured using high-performance liquid chromatogra-
