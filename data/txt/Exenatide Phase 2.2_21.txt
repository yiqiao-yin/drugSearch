A total of 116 patients with type 2 diabe-tes were recruited from 24 sites through-out the U.S., resulting in 109 subjectsrandomized to the intent-to-treat popula-tion. Of the seven excluded subjects, fourdid not meet the inclusion/exclusion cri-teria after screening, two withdrew con-sent, and one had an adverse event beforerandomization (motor vehicle accident).Baseline and demographic characteristicswere well balanced across the four treat-ment groups (Table 1). Serum fructosamine and HbA 1c AC2993 treatment led to statistically signiﬁcant ( P/H113490.004) reductions in serum fructosamine at day 28 [45, 39,and 46 /H9262mol/l for BID (bd), BID (bs), and TID (bds), respectively] relative toplacebo (5 /H9262mol/l; Fig. 1 A). Similarly, statistically signiﬁcant ( P/H113490.006) re- ductions in HbA 1cwere observed after all AC2993 regimens [1.1, 0.7, and
