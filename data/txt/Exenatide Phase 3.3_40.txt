with patients given glargine, those receiving exenatide lost rather than gained weight, had a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia, and had improved quality of life (with greater improvement in several weight-related domains). Conversely, patients given glargine were more likely to remain in the study, had lower FSG concentrations, and a lower incidence of both gastrointestinal adverse events and injection-site reactions. In both groups, changes in HbA 1c and bodyweight were  maintained for 3 years, suggesting that beneﬁ  ts persist  with continuing treatment. Uncontrolled long-term studies of exenatide 7,22 have also shown stabilisation with  time in responsive patients. Another controlled, long-term trial of exenatide, EUREXA, 23 showed that HbA1c  reductions were greater and more sustained at 2 and 3 years, and incidence of hypoglycaemia was signiﬁ  cantly  lower with twice-daily exenatide than with sulfonylureas. The mechanisms of action involved in responsiveness to Exenatide
