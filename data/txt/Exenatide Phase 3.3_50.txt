The absolute HbA 1c values achieved in patients given  glargine in our study are not very diﬀ  erent from those reported in other glargine treat-to-target studies (ranging from 6·9% to 7·8% [52–62 mmol/mol]). 28 In  previous studies with insulin, low HbA1c results were  associated with greater bodyweight gain and more frequent hypoglycaemia than in patients who did not achieve low HbA 1c values.29  The long-term nature of our study has other potential  beneﬁ  ts and limitations. Because clinical trials are often
