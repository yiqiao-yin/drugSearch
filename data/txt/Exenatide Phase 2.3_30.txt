ability issues and safety considerations, further studies are necessary to better un-derstand the available therapeutic optionswhen choosing adjunctive therapy forsulfonylureas. When assessing the glycemic effect of a therapeutic, it is perhaps more impor-tant to ascertain the proportion of sub-jects who achieved a goal of HbA 1c/H113497%. At the 10- and 5- /H9262g doses, 41 and 33% of subjects who completed the studyachieved this goal, respectively, com-pared with 9% of subjects administeredplacebo. In addition, more subjects with-drew from the study due to loss of glyce-mic control in the placebo arm than in theexenatide arms. The exenatide glucose-lowering effect would appear to be attrib-uted to a robust effect on daytimepostprandial glycemia (7,8) because theglucose-lowering effect on fasting plasmaglucose was modest in both exenatidetreatment arms (a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction inthe 10- /H9262g arm but not in the 5- /H9262g arm). The reduction ( /H11011/H110020.9% at week 30) was
