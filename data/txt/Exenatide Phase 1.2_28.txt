dent rise in serum insulin concentrations within the first 3 hafter AC2993 administration, compared with placebo (Fig.5B;P/H110210.001). In addition, there was a statistically signifi- cant, AC2993 dose-dependent increase in fasting insulin forAUC 0–3h(P/H110210.0001). In sharp contrast, placebo treatment exhibited relatively stable insulin concentrations throughout the 8-h period of observation. The rise and peak of seruminsulin concentrations following AC2993 administration co-incided with the rapid decline of fasting glucose concentra-tions. After 3 –4 h post dose and coincident with reaching the glucose concentration nadir, mean serum insulin concentra-TABLE 2.
