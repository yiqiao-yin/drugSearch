supports the notion that suppression of glucagon secretionis not merely related to the slowing of nutrient presentationto the small intestine (gastric emptying). Moreover, suppres-sion of glucagon was observed over the range of diabetesseverity (not shown), demonstrating that this effect ofAC2993 is robust. Given the well documented elevated fast-ing and postprandial glucagon concentrations in patientswith type 2 diabetes (40) and the known action of glucagonto maintain hepatic glucose output (41), it is reasonable toexpect that glucagon suppression by AC2993 contributed tothe overall effect of lowering glucose concentrations in boththe fasting and postprandial periods. Similar to insulin con-centrations, glucagon concentrations also returned towardbaseline beyon d 3 h post injection during the fasting state,
