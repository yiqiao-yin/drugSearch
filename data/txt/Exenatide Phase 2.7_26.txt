point, reductions from baseline in postprandial glu-  cose excursions were significantly greater with ex-  enatide 5 and 10 pg, respectively, compared with pla-  cebo after the morning (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002) and  evening (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001) meals. These reduc-  tions were similar between both exenatide groups and  placebo at midday. Reductions in daily mean post-  prandial glucose excursions from baseline to end  point were significantly greater with exenatide 5 pg  (-21.3 [2.7] mg/dL; P < 0.001) and exenatide 10 pg  (-24.7 [2.7] mg/dL; P < 0.001) than placebo (-8.3  [2.5] mg/dL).  Weight  Weight values were comparable across treatment  groups at baseline, with means of 85 to 86 kg. Signifi- cant differences in weight change from baseline were  observed between exenatide 5 pg and placebo at  weeks 16 and 24 (both, P < 0.027) and between ex-  enatide 10 pg and placebo at weeks 8, 12, 16, and 24  (all, P < 0.007). At 24 weeks, weight changes from
