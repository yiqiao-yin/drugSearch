AWARD-9, these AEs occurred in 12.0%, 11.3% and 6.0% ofdulaglutide-treated patients and 1.3%, 4.0% and 0.0% of placebo- treated patients, respectively. 23 The DURATION-7 study has some limitations. Notably, IG titra- tion was not strictly adhered to after randomization in all patients,despite FPG values being above those specified in the INITIATE titra- tion algorithm (4.0-5.5 mmol/L [72-99 mg/dL]). 28Suboptimal titration was shown by smaller-than-expected increases in the IG dose, espe-cially with placebo, despite elevated FPG levels. Had IG titration beenmore aggressive, the relative difference in the IG dose with exenatide QW vs placebo would be expected to have been larger. Althoughresults across studies are not directly comparable, HbA1c reductionin the DURATION-7 study was similar to that in a separate studyevaluating exenatide BID added to titrated IG, 6whereas, in the DURATION-5 study, HbA1c reduction was significantly greater withexenatide QW vs exenatide BID.
