Effect of AC2993 on postprandial plasma glucose, plasma insulin, plasma glucagon, serum triglyceride, and plasmaacetaminophen concentrations (study A) Postprandial plasma glucose. Significant reductions in mean postprandial plasma glucose concentrations were noted dur-ing the 300 min following treatment with 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993, compared with placebo (Fig. 1; P/H110210.05). During treatment with placebo on d 5, mean plasma glucose concentrationsincreased from 170.3 /H110069.1 mg/dl (9.5 /H110060.5 mmol/liter) at
