weekly exenatide continued to be eﬃ   cacious during 5 years of treatment. However, after a placebo-controlled period of 30 weeks, all patients in the study were given exenatide in an open-label extension, so diabetes progression or other confounders could have aﬀ  ected the results. DURATION-3 was a long-term, randomised trial  comparing once-weekly exenatide with basal insulin (titrated glargine) in patients with type 2 diabetes who did not have adequate glycaemic control with metformin with or without sulfonylureas.
