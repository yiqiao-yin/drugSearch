at end point. Exenatide was associated with improved  postprandial glucose control, known to play an im-  portant role in overall glycemic control -~4,-~5 and recog-  nized as an independent risk factor for macrovascular  disease} 6  In this group of patients, who had mean weights at  baseline of 85 to 86 kg, exenatide 5- and 10-gg mono-  therapy was associated with clinically meaningful re-  ductions in weight of-2.8 and -3.1 kg, respectively,  consistent with the mechanism of reduced food intake  reported in other studies. -~7,-~8 The weight reductions observed with exenatide monotherapy were consistent  with or greater than those observed in previous placebo-  controlled and open-label comparator (insulin) stud-  ies of the efficacy of exenatide in combination with  oral antidiabetic agents. 3-9 Combined, these data sug-  gest that exenatide is associated with weight loss re-  gardless of the presence of background oral antidia-  betic therapy.
