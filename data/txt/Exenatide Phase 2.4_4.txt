412 M. S. Fineman et al. include glucose-dependent en hancement of insulin secre- tion, glucose-dependent suppression of inappropriately high glucagon secretion, and slowing of gastric empty- ing [1–7]. At least some of these antidiabetic actions(e.g. enhancement of insuli n secretion) may be medi- ated by the binding of exenatide to the GLP-1 receptor [8]. While GLP-1 exhibits a half-life of less than 1 min, exendin-4 has a half-life of approximately 20 min whengiven intravenously, thus making it an attractive poten- tial drug candidate. In animal models of diabetes and in insulin-secretory cell lines, exenatide and GLP-1 report-edly improve β-cell function by increasing the expression of the key genes involved in insulin secretion, by increas- ing insulin biosynthesis, and by augmenting β-cell mass through multiple mechanisms [4]. Data obtained in ani-mal models also indicate that exenatide and GLP-1 reduce food intake, cause weight loss, and have an insulin-
