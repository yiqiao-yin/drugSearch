study medication injection to evaluate concentration profiles of plasmaglucose, serum insulin, and plasma glucagon. No treatments were ad-ministered on intervening d 2, 4, and 6. Subjects in both studies were monitored for safety by assessment of adverse events, physical examination findings, electrocardiograms, vitalsigns, and laboratory values (serum chemistry, hematology, and uri-nalysis). For both studies, quantitation of plasma glucose, insulin, andglucagon were performed by Esoterix Laboratories (Calabasas Hills,CA) according to well established methods. Glucose was measuredusing the glucose/HK reagent set (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, cat. no. 1876899) for glucose analysis based on the glucose hexokinasemethodology (33, 34). Insulin was measured using a two-site immuno-chemiluminometric assay. Glucagon was measured using a double-antibody RIA. Acetaminophen was assayed by MDS Pharma Servicesusing an HPLC methodology (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Statistical methods
