a less complex dose-escalation regimen. In summary, a dose-escalation regimen to a target dose of exenatide reduced the proportion of subjects experienc- ing dose-limiting nausea and vomiting compared to acute exposure to the same target dose. In addition, exenatidetreatment in the exenatide-primed arm was associatedwith reduced fasting plasma glucose concentrations, with no apparent loss of the glucoregulatory activity of the drug. This study design could potentially be generallyapplicable to other drugs with dose-limiting side effects.
