All efﬁcacy and safetyanalyses were performed on the ITT pop-ulation, with the exception of the percent-age of subjects achieving A1C /H113497%. For the latter analysis, the more clinically rel-evant population of evaluable subjects (allrandomized subjects who completedtreatment through week 30 and receivedat least 80% of the study medication in-jections) with baseline A1C /H110227% was used. For ITT subjects who had recordedvalues for at least one scheduled visit sub-sequent to the baseline measurement,missing data were imputed from sched-uled visits using the last-observation-carried-forward method.
