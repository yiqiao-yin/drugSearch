cause the changes in concentrations of insulin and glucagon are coincident, the effects of AC2993 to enhance insulin se-cretion and suppress glucagon secretion may be consideredglucose dependent. Currently available secretagogues andexogenous insulin administration do not suppress the par-adoxical postprandial rise of glucagon concentrations ob-served in patients with diabetes (42). This results in an in-appropriately low insulin:glucagon ratio in the portal vein(to a greater extent than with exogenous insulin) contributingto sustained rates of excess hepatic glucose production (43).Thus, by virtue of its effects to enhance endogenous insulinand lower glucagon secretion, AC2993 would tend to rees-tablish a more physiologic and favorable portal vein ratio ofinsulin to glucagon, compared with the effect of currentlyavailable agents. Given the initially flat postprandial glucose profile, it is
