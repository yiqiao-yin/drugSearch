181 Am J Health-Syst Pharm—Vol 62  Jan 15, 2005REPORTS Type 2 diabetes mellitus the presence of hyperglycemia. Al- though one mechanism of exenatideaction is to slow gastric emptying,there was no evidence from a studyexamining the effects of 28-day ex-enatide administration that exenatidetreatment resulted in the inductionor exacerbation of conditions such assubclinical gastroparesis. 23 Thus, the combined actions of exenatide onpostprandial insulinotropism, gluca-gon suppression, and the slowing ofgastric emptying markedly reducepostprandial glucose excursions afterexenatide administration. Conclusion Administration of preprandial ex- enatide by s.c. injection resulted indose-proportional exenatide phar-macokinetics and antidiabetic phar-macodynamic activity. At dosesranging from 0.02 to 0.2 µg/kg, ex- enatide dose-dependently reducedpostprandial plasma glucose excur-sion by insulinotropism, suppressionof plasma glucagon, and slowing ofgastric emptying.
