cremental postprandial plasma glucose concentrations at weeks 4 and 30, as mea-sured by incremental AUC (15–180 min) and incremental Cave(average concentration; P/H110210.01 vs. placebo). At week 30, changes from baseline for AUC(15–180 min) were/H11002474/H1100687 mmol /H18528min /H185281/H110021(10-/H9262 g arm),/H11002318/H1100649 mmol /H18528min /H185281/H110021(5-/H9262g arm), and /H110023/H1100672 mmol /H18528min /H185281/H110021(pla- cebo arm) and for Cavewere/H110022.9/H110060.76mmol/l (10-/H9262 g-arm), /H110021.9/H110060.3 mmol/l (5-/H9262g arm), and 0.0 /H110060.4 mmol/l (placebo arm). Thus, incremental plasma glucoseAUC values were reduced by 59% (5-/H9262 g arm) and 87% (10-/H9262 g arm) compared with a/H110211% decrease in the placebo arm.
