with proinsulin. There was no signiﬁcantcross-reaction for the proinsulin assaywith IGF-I, IGF-II, C-peptide, or insulin.Plasma exenatide and anti-exenatide anti-bodies were measured as described previ- ously (12). RESULTS Study population demographics wereevenly balanced across treatment arms(Fig. 1). The intent-to-treat populationcomprised 336 subjects with 272 subjectscompleting the study (81%) and 64 with-drawing early (19%). Withdrawal rateswere equally distributed across treatmentarms. Other than metformin, the mostfrequently used concomitant medicationswere ACE inhibitors (114 subjects, 34%),hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase Figure 4— Body weight in the intent-to- treat population. A: Change in body weight from baseline. Baseline weights were101/H110062 kg in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm, 100/H110062k gi nt h e5 - /H9262g exenatide arm, and 100/H110062 kg in the placebo arm. B: Change in weight from baseline stratiﬁed by base-line BMI /H1102130 and/H1135030 kg/m
