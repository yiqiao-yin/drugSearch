exenatide titer (n /H1100545). The ExBID patients with higher antibody to exenatide titer (n /H110059) had HbA1c changes rang- ing from /H110022.2% to /H110010.6%. In both treatment groups, progressive reductions in mean body weight were observed through 24 wk [Fig. 2E;between group difference: /H110020.95 kg ( /H110021.9, 0.01)]. By wk 24, approximately 77% of ExQW and 63% of ExBIDpatients experienced weight loss, whereas 71% of ExQWand 51% of ExBID patients experienced both a reductionin HbA1c and weight loss (Fig. 2F). A consistently positive effect of ExQW therapy on the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to wk 24 was ob-served, regardless of background antidiabetic therapy (Fig.3). Reductions in HbA1c, the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c targets, andreductions in body weight observedacross diabetes management methodswere consistent with results observed inthe overall ITT population.
