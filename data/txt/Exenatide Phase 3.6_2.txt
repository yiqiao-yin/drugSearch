2010, and J an 17, 2011. P atients aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes treated with lifestyle modiﬁ   cation and oral  antihyperglycaemic drugs were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation sequence with a voice response system, to receive injections of once-daily liraglutide (1·8 mg) or once-weekly exenatide (2 mg). Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) from baseline to week 26. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01029886. Findings Of 912 randomised patients, 911 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (450 liraglutide,  461 exenatide). The least-squares mean change in HbA1c was greater in patients in the liraglutide group (–1·48%,  SE 0·05; n=386) than in those in the exenatide group (–1·28%, 0·05; 390) with the treatment diﬀ  erence (0·21%,
