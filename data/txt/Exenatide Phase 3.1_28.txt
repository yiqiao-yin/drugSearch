weight comparable to those in a previ-ously reported double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exenatide QW at thesame dose (18) and were consistent withcontinuous exenatide exposure. Theseimprovements were greater than thosepreviously observed with exenatide BIDin both placebo-controlled (9–12) andopen-label comparator trials (13–15). It isimportant to note that improvements inA1C were observed across the spectrumof baseline A1C values and weight losscategories. Treatment with exenatide QWwas generally well tolerated and treat-ment-emergent adverse events weregenerally mild to moderate. As in theinitial 30-week phase, the only inci-dences of mild to moderate hypoglyce-mia occurred in patients concomitantlyreceiving an SFU. It is noteworthy that patients switch-
