This pooling took into account the num-ber of endocrinologists, patient accessi-bility to specialty diabetes care, andquality of managed care in the geographiclocations. The intent-to-treat population was deﬁned as all randomized subjects whoreceived at least one injection of medica-tion starting from the evening of day 1. Allefﬁcacy and safety analyses were per-formed on the intent-to-treat populationwith the exception of the percentage ofsubjects achieving HbA 1c/H113497% (evalu - able population) and the meal tolerancecohort. For intent-to-treat subjects, miss-ing data (including missing values at inter-mediate visits) were imputed fromscheduled visits using the last-observation-carried-forward method. The least squaremeans and SE were derived from the gen-eral linear model for each treatment. Pair-wise comparisons of the treatment effectswere performed using Fisher’s protected
