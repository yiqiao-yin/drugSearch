conducted at the signiﬁcance level of 0.05(two sided). A general linear model wasused to test for differences in the changefrom baseline to each visit in A1C andweight across treatments (22,23). Factorsin the model included treatment, strata ofbaseline A1C, sulfonylurea managementgroup, and aggregate study site as ﬁxedeffects. Before data analysis, sites werepooled according to geographic locationto prevent loss of too many degrees offreedom in the model. Pairwise compari-sons of the treatment effects were per-formed using Fisher’s protected testingprocedure to control type I errors due tomultiple comparisons (24). Similar anal-yses were performed for each fasting met-abolic parameter and for postprandialplasma glucose concentrations withoutadjusting for the multiple comparisons. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population
