Safety and tolerability Frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence /H113505%) in the ITT population were primarily gastrointestinal in nature. Nauseawas reported as severe in 6.5% of exenatidecases (3.0% for placebo), while vomiting wasreported as severe in 1.6% of exenatide cases(0% for placebo). The most common adverseevents among subjects receiving any dose of ex-enatide were nausea (40.7% in the pooled exe-natide group vs. 12.1% in the placebo group)and vomiting (9.8% in the pooled exenatidegroup vs. 3.0% in the placebo group). Nauseawas greater in the 7.5 /H9262g b.i.d. (61.3%) and 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. (51.6%) treatment groups than in the 2.5 /H9262g b.i.d. (23.3%) and 5.0 /H9262g b.i.d. (25.8%)
