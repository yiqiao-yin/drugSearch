in study A ( n = 8). All exenatide-treated groups (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 µg/kg) had significantly reduced postprandial plasma glucose concentrations with similar pharmacodynamic pro- files ( p ≤ 0.01). Patients received an enteral nutrient formulation (7 kcal/kg) and aceta- minophen (20 mg/kg) within five minutes of receiving the study drug. (B) Mean ± S.E. (bars) plasma glucose profile in study B, part 2 ( n = 8). Exenatide treatment reduced postprandial glucose concentrations ( p < 0.05). Study drug was administered at 0 hour. In study B, an enteral nutrient formulation (7 kcal/kg) and acetaminophen (20 mg/kg) were given 15 min- utes after administration of the study drug. 500 400 300 200 100 0 –1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 –1 0 1 2 3 4 5Glucose (mg/dL) Time (hr) Time (hr)Glucose (mg/dL)A BStudy DrugPlacebo Exenatide 0.1 µg/kg Exenatide 0.2 µg/kg Exenatide 0.3 µg/kg Exenatide 0.4 µg/kg Study DrugPlacebo Exenatide 0.02 µg/kg Exenatide 0.05 µg/kg
