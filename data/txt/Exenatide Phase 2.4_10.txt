Exenatide Dose-escalation 413 of the study medication was injected subcutaneously in the abdominal region 15 min before breakfast and dinner, and at bedtime. This design led to comparable blinded exposure to the study procedures between the two arms, and therefore allowed unbiased comparison of the proportion of subjects experiencing dose-limiting sideeffects between a dose-escalation procedure and an acute introduction of a high dose of exenatide.
