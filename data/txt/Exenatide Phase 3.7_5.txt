When glycaemic targets are not achieved with basal insulin, guidelines recommend uptitration of the basal insulin dose3–5or, if unsuccessful, intensification with additional therapies, including aglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), 3–5prandial insulin,3–5sodium –glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i),4,5or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i).4Among injectable options, adding a GLP-1RA to basal insulin therapy offers severaladvantages 6–12over progressive intensification with prandial insulin up to 3 times daily.13–17GLP-1RAs reduce hyperglycaemia through differing and complementary mechanisms to exogenous insulin; theystimulate endogenous insulin synthesis/secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, inhibit glucagon secretion, increase satiety,reduce food intake, and some slow gastric emptying. 2GLP-1RAs achieve glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reductions similar to orgreater than those achieved with prandial insulin, 18,19with the addi-
