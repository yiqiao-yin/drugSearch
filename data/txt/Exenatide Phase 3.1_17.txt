(/H110021.4 to/H110021.1%) and /H110021.3% (/H110021.5 to /H110021.2%) in the exenatide QW-only and exenatide BID 3exenatide QW groups, respectively (supplementary Fig. 1, avail-able in an online appendix at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ dc09- 1914/DC1). Larger reductions in A1C atweek 52 were achieved in patients with abaseline A1C /H113509.0%:/H110022.8% (/H110023.1 to /H110022.5%) for the exenatide QW-only group (baseline A1C 9.7%) and /H110022.6%(/H110023.0 to /H110022.3%) in the exenatide BID3exenatide QW group (baseline A1C 9.6%). Body weight decreased similarly in both treatment groups. At week 52, theleast squares mean (95% CI) changes inbody weight were /H110024.1 kg (/H110025.3 to/H110022.9 kg) and /H110024.5 kg (/H110025.7 to/H110023.3 kg) in the exenatide QW-only and exenatideBID3exenatide QW groups, respectively (Fig. 2 E). The distribution of the changein A1C with respect to changes in body weight is shown in Fig. 2 F. Ninety-seven
