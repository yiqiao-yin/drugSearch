sitagliptin to exenatide once-weekly (week 26 ﬁweek 52: 38% ﬁ58%; P= 0.0002). Body weight Patients who switched from pioglitazone to exenatide once- weekly exhibited a signiﬁcant weight reduction ( )3.0 kg; P< 0.0001; Fig. 3), such that body weight was similar to original baseline weight by week 52. Patients originally treatedwith sitagliptin also exhibite d a signiﬁcant reduction in weight after switching to exenatide once-weekly ( )1.1 kg; P= 0.0006). Patients who received exenatide once-weekly throughout thetrial on average had a + 0.7 kg ( P= 0.0325) increase in weight from week 26 to week 52, resulting in a )1.8/C60.5 kg (P= 0.0002) reduction from original baseline.
