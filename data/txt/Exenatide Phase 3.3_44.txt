N evertheless, the greater reductions in FSG  concentrations in patients given glargine, yet larger HbA1c  reductions in those given exenatide, suggest that improvements in postprandial glucose control in the exenatide group contributed to the improved HbA 1c control  in this group. Indeed, patients given exenatide once weekly who did not achieve HbA 1c control had deteriorating FSG  control, whereas patients receiving glargine who did not achieve HbA 1c control maintained FSG reductions,  suggesting that worsening of postprandial glucose control contributed to increased HbA 1c in glargine recipients. During our long-term study, several cardiovascular risk
