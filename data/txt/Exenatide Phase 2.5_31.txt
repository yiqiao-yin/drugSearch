All other hypoglycemic events were mildor moderate in intensity, and there wereno withdrawals due to hypoglycemia. At week 30, 49% of exenatide-treated subjects (193 of 398) had detectable anti-exenatide antibody titers, with the major-ity of titers in the low range (1/5 to 1/125titer). The anti-exenatide antibodies hadno predictive effect on the magnitude ofan individual’s glycemic response or theincidence of adverse events. Management of sulfonylurea dosing In the MAX group, all treatment armsmaintained relatively constant dosage lev-els of sulfonylurea throughout the study.
