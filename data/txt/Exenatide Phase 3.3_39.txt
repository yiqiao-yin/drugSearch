However, individual changes in patients with high titres varied widely (–3·3% to 2·7% [–36·1 to 29·5 mmol/mol]). Discussion We have shown that HbA1c control is better with  exenatide once weekly than with glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes in a 3-year period (panel). We recorded sustained HbA 1c improvement in half the  patients given exenatide and in slightly more than two-ﬁ fths of those given glargine over 3 years. Compared
