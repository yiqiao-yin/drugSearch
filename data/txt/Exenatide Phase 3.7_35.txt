(<53 mmol/mol) with no body weight gain and no major hypoglycae- mia over the 28-week treatment period (22.1% vs 2.6%, respectively;no hypothesis testing was performed because of the prespecifiedhierarchical testing sequence; nominal P< .001) (Table 2, Figure 2B). No significant differences were observed between exenatide QW and placebo for change from baseline to week 28 in waist circumfer- ence, DBP or fasting lipids (Table 2). There was a small numericdecrease with exenatide QW ( −2.6 mm Hg) vs placebo ( −0.7 mm Hg) in SBP (difference, −1.8 mm Hg; nominal P= .105). 3.2.3 |Patient-reported outcomes Patients in both treatment groups reported improved treatment satis- faction as assessed by DTSQ-s total score; the improvement wasgreater with exenatide QW (Table S7 in File S1). At week 28, anumerically greater proportion of patients receiving exenatide QW vs placebo reported weight loss and improvement in all 9 areas assessed by the SHIELD-WQ-9 (Table S7 in File S1).
