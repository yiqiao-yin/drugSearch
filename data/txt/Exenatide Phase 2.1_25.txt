with significant reductions in body weight. The absolute reduction in HbA 1cobserved in clinical trials can be influenced by a number offactors, including the value of HbA 1cat base- line, disease severity at baseline, backgroundtherapy, pre-existing diet and exercise regimen,and others. 26â€“28In this trial, mean baseline HbA 1clevels ranged from 7.4% to 7.7%, in- dicative of a moderately well-controlled patientpopulation. Therefore, modest reductions inHbA 1cwould be anticipated because the mag- nitude of change in HbA 1cis related to the start- ing HbA 1cvalue (i.e., greater reductions in HbA 1care generally seen following treatment in patients with poorer control at baseline26). Although HbA 1cis employed as a long-term marker of glycemic control, reflecting glucoseconcentrations over the previous 3 months, anumber of studies have assessed HbA 1cfol-
