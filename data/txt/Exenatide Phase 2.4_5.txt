sensitizing effect [4]. Exenatide is a 39-amino acid synthetic peptide currently undergoing clinical evaluation. It has demonstrated potentially beneﬁcial antidiabetic actions at doses rangingfrom 0 .05µg/kg to 0 .4µg/kg [1–4]. However, exenatide also causes dose-limiting nausea and vomiting. Data from previous short-term controlled studies suggestedthat the incidence of nausea and vomiting caused byexenatide decreased in parallel with increasing duration of treatment. It is not uncommon to observe drug-induced side effects that subside with increasing duration ofdrug exposure, a phenomenon known as tolerance [9]. While this phenomenon is relatively well established for small molecule therapeutics, it is less well establishedfor peptide hormones. Moreover, tolerance induction has largely been established by clinical practice rather than by formal assessment. A critical step in drug development is establishing the correct dose(s) of a therapeutic agent. Dose-limiting
