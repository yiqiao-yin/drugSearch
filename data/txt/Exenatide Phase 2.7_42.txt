Moretto et al.  fects of exenatide monotherapy on glycemic control  and to determine whether progressive weight reduc-  tions could be expected with exenatide monotherapy,  as has been reported with exenatide in combination  with oral antidiabetic agents during open-label exten-  sions of placebo-controlled studies. 11 Next, the influ-  ence of patients' diet and exercise regimens on weight  reductions are unclear, as there were no standardized  diet and exercise recommendations in the current  study. Finally, the study entry criteria and the limited  racial distribution of patients may limit the ability to  extrapolate the results to the general population.  CONCLUSIONS  In these patients with type 2 diabetes naive to treat-  ment with antidiabetic agents, exenatide monotherapy  was associated with improved HbAlc , improved fast-  ing and postprandial glucose control, reduced weight,  improved 13-cell function (HOMA-B), and improved
