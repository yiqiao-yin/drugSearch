(A) Event incidence wassigniﬁcantly lower in the exenatide-primed arm ( p= 0.0018). Analysis up to Day 43 (the day after the last dose day for the last subject) yielded values of 0.68 for the exenatide-naive arm and 0.28 for the exenatide-primed arm ( p≤0.0001). Because the study design allowed a ±1-day window for each visit, there was some variation in the actual day the subjects in theexenatide-naive arm received the initial 0 .24µg/kg exenatide
