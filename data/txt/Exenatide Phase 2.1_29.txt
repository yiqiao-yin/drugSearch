trolled Phase 3 clinical trials, have demon- strated that doses up to 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. were gen- erally well tolerated, especially when dose es-calation was employed. 8,9,46â€“48When considered in combination, these data demon-strate that the magnitude of glucose loweringand weight loss increases with increasing dosesof exenatide, supporting dose escalation to 10.0/H9262g b.i.d. to optimize glucose lowering. Exenatide was associated with dose-depen- dent increases in gastrointestinal symptoms,with nausea the most commonly reportedsymptom. These side effects were generally re-ported as mild to moderate, and the incidencedeclined over the 28-day trial period. In thelong-term controlled Phase 3 trials, exenatide-treated patients were initiated at 5 /H9262g b.i.d. for 4 weeks and then escalated to 10 /H9262g b.i.d. This approach has been shown to be effective in mit-igating the incidence and intensity of the gas-trointestinal side effects of exenatide. 49In con-
