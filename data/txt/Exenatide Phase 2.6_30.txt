els, where it is possible to exert a greaterHbA 1c-lowering effect (33,34). Reduction of HbA1cwas the result of a modest decrease in fasting plasma glucose con- centrations in keeping with the pharma-cokinetic proÔ¨Åle of exenatide and, moreimportantly, a sustained robust glucose-lowering effect postprandially, as indi-cated by the meal challenge cohort. It is also noteworthy that the im- provement in glycemia was coupled withoverall weight loss and no increase in hy-poglycemia. Exenatide treatment eliciteddose-dependent reductions in bodyweight ( /H110113% at the 10- /H9262g dose) that did
