effects of AC2993 on postprandial plasmacortisol on days 1 and 28 (data notshown). The range of means was 246–480 nmol/l. There was a small, acute,transient increase in serum cortisol con-centrations after dosing with AC2993 onday 1, as compared with placebo. Therewas no rise in postdose mean cortisol val-ues in any of the treatment groups atday 28. Fifteen (19%) of the 81 AC2993- treated patients developed low-titer anti-AC2993 antibodies during the study.There was no evidence that patients withan antibody response had a diminishedglycemic response. Adverse events The most common treatment-emergentadverse events reported were nausea(31% overall incidence) and hypoglyce-mia (15% overall incidence). The normalrange for plasma glucose is 3.9–5.8mmol/l. Values /H110213.3 mmol/l were con-
