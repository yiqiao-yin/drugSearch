continuous exposure to higher phar macological concentrations of a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Furthermore, the maintenance of glycaemic control and accompanying weight reduction observed following the switch from pioglitazone to exenatide once-weeklymay be of particular clinical signiﬁcance for some patients. Ofnote, exenatide once-weekly has also demonstrated greaterimprovement in HbA 1cand body weight compared with titrated insulin glargine, with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia butwith a greater incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events [14]. Thus, exenatide once-weekly has been demonstrated to elicitgreater HbA 1cimprovement when directly compared with three agents that are commonly used aft er metformin (sitagliptin, pioglitazone, insulin glargine). The current ﬁndings suggest that exenatide once-weekly may also be a suitable treatment
