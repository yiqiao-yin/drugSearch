between treatment groups (Table S6 in File S1). During the IG titra-tion phase, the mean daily IG dose increased from 39 to 50 units/din the group subsequently randomized to exenatide QW and from39 to 52 units/d in the group subsequently randomized to placebo;FPG decreased from 10.0 to 8.2 mmol/L (179.8-147.5 mg/dL) andfrom 9.8 to 8.1 mmol/L (176.8-146.5 mg/dL), respectively; and HbA1c decreased from 9.1% to 8.5% (76-70 mmol/mol) in bothgroups (Table S6 in File S1). After randomization, exenatide QW was associated with a signifi- cantly greater HbA1c reduction from baseline to week 28 vs placebo(least-squares mean [LSM] difference, −0.73% [ −8.0 mmol/mol]; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.93% to −0.53% [ −10.2 to −5.8 mmol/ mol]; P< .001; final HbA1c, 7.55% [59 mmol/mol] and 8.24%
