(/H1100235/H110065 mg/dl vs./H1100212/H110065 mg/dl; P/H110050.0008). Similar reductions in mean body weight from baseline to wk 24 were observed in both groups ( /H110022.3/H110060.4 kg and /H110021.4/H110060.4 kg). Both treatments were generally well tolerated. Transient and predominantly mild to moderate nausea, the mostfrequent adverse event, was less common with ExQW (14%) than with ExBID (35%). Injection-sitereactions were infrequent, but more common with ExQW. No major hypoglycemia occurred. Conclusions: Continuous glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonism with ExQW resulted in supe- rior glycemic control, with less nausea, compared with ExBID in patients with type 2 diabetes. Bothgroups lost weight. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 96: 1301â€“1310, 2011) ISSN Print 0021-972X ISSN Online 1945-7197
