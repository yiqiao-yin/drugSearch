fairly short, a long-term trial provides useful data about whether eﬃ   cacy, tolerability, and safety are sustained with long-term use. However, follow-up decreased in frequency after week 26 (intervals increased from 1–4 weeks to 12 weeks), and the study duration could have led to more discontinuations than in a shorter study (especially due to patient decision). Furthermore, any withdrawals caused by loss of glycaemic control could potentially have led to bias because of a responsive subpopulation remaining in the study. However, the mITT and completer populations had similar HbA 1c changes and target achievement. An  extended study duration probably also increased the number of drug changes in the exenatide group. After week 48, many patients had alterations in their concomitant glucose-lowering therapies, which mean that we cannot conclude whether all glycaemic improvements are attributable to exenatide alone. Nevertheless, we believe that the greater eﬀ  ect on HbA
