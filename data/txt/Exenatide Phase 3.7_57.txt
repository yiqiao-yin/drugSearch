33This seemingly inconsistent find- ing regarding the glycaemic efficacy of exenatide QW vs BID is prob-ably explained by suboptimal IG titration in the DURATION-7 studyvs the exenatide BID + IG study (mean IG difference, 2 vs 7 units, 6 respectively) and by differences in study design (lack of an IG titrationphase before randomization in the exenatide BID + IG study). 6 A similar suboptimal IG titration was observed in the HARMONY-6 study,22but also in other studies using various basal insulins.34,35This probably reflects real-world clinical practice, where clinical inertia and concern about body weight gain and increasedhypoglycaemia with insulin uptitration may result in physician/patientreluctance to adhere to strict algorithms. 20,21 In summary, in patients with T2DM who were inadequately con- trolled despite titrated IG /C6metformin, adding exenatide QW
