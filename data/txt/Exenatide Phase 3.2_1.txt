continued exenatide once-weekly treatment and (ii) switchin g from sitagliptin or pioglitazone to exenatide once-weekly. Methods Randomised oral medications were discontinued and all patients received exenatide once-weekly. Of the 364 patients [original baseline HbA 1c8.5/C61.1% (70 mmol ⁄mol), fasting plasma glucose 9.0 /C62.5 mmol ⁄l, weight 88 /C620 kg) who continued into the open-label period, 319 patients (88%) completed 52 weeks. Results Evaluable patients who received only exenatide once-week ly demonstrated signiﬁcant 52-week improvements (least square mean /C6se)i nH b A 1c()1.6/C60.1%), fasting plasma glucose ( )1.8/C60.3 mmol ⁄l) and weight ( )1.8/C60.5 kg). Evaluable patients who switched from sitagliptin to exenatide on ce-weekly demonstrated signiﬁcant incremental improvements in HbA 1c()0.3/C60.1%), fasting plasma glucose ( )0.7/C60.2 mmol ⁄l) and weight ( )1.1/C60.3 kg). Patients who switched
