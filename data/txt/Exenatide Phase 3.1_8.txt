The Diabetes Therapy Utilization: Re- searching Changes in A1C, Weight andOther Factors Through Intervention withExenatide Once Weekly (DURATION-1)trial was designed as a two-stage protocol.We previously reported the ﬁrst stage, arandomized open-label comparison of ex-enatide QW to exenatide BID in patientswith type 2 diabetes over 30 weeks (17).Both therapies improved glycemic con-trol, and the improvement in A1C ob-served with exenatide QW treatment wassigniﬁcantly greater than that observedwith exenatide BID ( /H110021.9 vs./H110021.5%, re- spectively). Similar improvements inbody weight, blood pressure, and fastinglipids were demonstrated with both formsof exenatide therapy. We now describe52-week results from the second phase ofthe DURATION-1 trial which examinedthe safety and efﬁcacy of 1) switching from exenatide BID to exenatide QW after30 weeks of treatment and 2) continuing exenatide QW treatment for an additional22 weeks (52 weeks total).
