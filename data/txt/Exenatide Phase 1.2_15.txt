In both studies, the pharmacodynamic parameter assessed for plasma glucose [area under the curve (AUC)(0-t)] was calculated using the in - cremental plasma glucose concentration curve, which was derived bysubtracting the baseline glucose concentration from each subsequentvalue. The baseline value for plasma glucose was calculated as the meanof the/H1100215 min and /H110025 min time points. Pharmacodynamic parameters for insulin, glucagon, and acetaminophen [AUC (0-t)] were calculated from the respective plasma or serum concentration profiles and were logetransformed before analysis. Pharmacodynamic evaluations in both studies are relative to the time of dose administration. Evaluable subjects were defined as those who completed the majority of treatment periodswith sufficient data to allow reliable evaluation of the pharmacodynamicparameters. Pharmacodynamic analyses were performed using an ANOVA or
