HbAlc value >7.0% at baseline, 48% (27/56; P =  0.024) and 46% (26/56; P = 0.036) in the exenatide  5- and 10-pg groups, respectively, achieved an HbAlc  value <7.0% at end point, compared with 29%  (17/59) of those who received placebo (Figure 3B).  Including patients who had a baseline HbAI~ value  _<7.0% in this analysis, 55% (42/76; P = NS) and 58%  (44/76; P = 0.030) in the exenatide 5- and 10-pg  groups, respectively, had or achieved an HbAI~ value  _<7.0% at end point, compared with 41% (31/75) of  those who received placebo (Figure 3B).  Fasting Serum Glucose  FSG values were similar across treatment groups  at baseline, with means of 154 to 166 mg/dL. At  end point, changes from baseline in FSG were -17.5  (4.0) mg/dL in the exenatide 5-pg group (P = 0.029)  and -18.7 (4.0) mg/dL in the exenatide 10-pg group  (P = 0.016) compared with -5.2 (4.0) mg/dL with  placebo. Six-Point SMBG Profile  At end point, 6-point SMBG profiles were signifi-
