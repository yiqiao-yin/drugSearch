Design: This was a 24-wk, randomized, open-label, comparator-controlled study. Setting: The study was conducted at 43 sites in the United States. Patients: The study population was 252 intent-to-treat patients with type 2 diabetes [baseline (mean /H11006 SD): glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 8.4 /H110061.2%, fasting plasma glucose 171 /H1100647 mg/dl, weight 96 /H1100620 kg] that were drug na√Øve (19%) or previously treated with one (47%) or multiple (35%) oral antidiabetic medications. Interventions: Interventions included ExQW 2 mg for 24 wk or ExBID 5 /H9262g for 4 wk followed by ExBID 10 /H9262g for 20 wk. Main Outcome Measure: The change in HbA1c from baseline to wk 24 was measured. Results: At 24 wk, ExQW produced significantly greater changes from baseline (least squares mean/H11006SE)vs.ExBID in HbA1c ( /H110021.6/H110060.1% vs./H110020.9/H110060.1%; P/H110210.0001) and fasting plasma glucose
