both fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in pa-tients with type 2 diabetes exhibiting a wide range of diseaseseverity. This overall acute antihyperglycemic effect is me-diated by several mechanisms. In the fasting state, bothglucose-dependent enhancement of insulin and suppressionof glucagon secretion are predominant while in the post-prandial period slowing of gastric emptying is additionallyoperative. These combined actions recapitulate many of theknown actions of GLP-1 on glucose-lowering in this patientpopulation (48, 49). This robust overall antidiabetic effectwarrants further development of AC2993 for the treatmentof patients with type 2 diabetes.Acknowledgments We thank James Ruggles, Roberta Allen, Armida Diaz, Mike Sierzega, Miriam Ahern, and Loretta Nielsen for assistance in the preparation ofthis manuscript.
