models, exenatide has been reported to enhancebeta-cell function and promote beta-cell prolifer-ation and neogenesis from precursor cells in vitroand in vivo. 18â€“20In vitro, some of these actions have been shown to be mediated through bind-ing to the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor. 21Ex- enatide is currently under clinical investigationas a potential treatment for patients with type 2diabetes inadequately treated with diet and ex-ercise and/or OADs. The effect of exenatide oninsulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabeteshas been shown to be glucose dependent. 8,9,13 The present study evaluated the effect of
