testing procedure to control type I errorsdue to multiple comparisons (30). Similaranalyses were performed for each fastingmetabolic parameter and for postprandialplasma glucose concentrations withoutadjusting for the multiple comparisons.Post hoc evaluation of change in bodyweight versus duration of nausea was per-formed using regression analysis. Theproportion of subjects achieving HbA 1c /H113497% was compared across treatment groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, wherein strata of baselineHbA 1cvalues served as the stratiﬁcation factor. Results are given as means /H11006SE unless otherwise indicated. The evaluable population was de- ﬁned as all randomized subjects whocompleted treatment through week 30and received at least 80% of the studymedication injections. Subjects whomissed 7 consecutive days of injectionsduring the last 2 months of the study wereexcluded. Safety analysis
