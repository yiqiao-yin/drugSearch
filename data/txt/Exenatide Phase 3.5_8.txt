/H9252-cell, suppress inappropriately elevated glucagonsecretion, reduce food intake, and slow gastric emptying (12–14). An extended-release formulation of exenatide admin- istered once weekly (ExQW), currently under review byregulatory authorities, provides steady-state concentra-tions of exenatide in the range shown to elicit effects onglycemic control within approximately 6–10 wk of initi-ating therapy (15, 16). As in the case of ExBID, ExQW hasbeen demonstrated to improve glycemic control and re-duce body weight (15, 16). The continuous GLP-1 recep-tor agonism achieved with ExQW has the potential toprovide improved glycemic control with additional ben-efits of weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and im-provement in lipid profiles. In addition, once-weekly ad-ministration has been reported to reduce patient burdenby providing patients with a weekly dosing regimen (17). Diabetes Therapy Utilization: Researching Changes in
