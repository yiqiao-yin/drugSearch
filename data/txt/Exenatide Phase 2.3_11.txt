tion of subjects across treatment arms. Aminimum sample size of 300 subjectswho had at least one postbaseline HbA 1c measurement was estimated to provide/H1101190% power to detect a difference of 0.6% in the change from baseline inHbA 1cvalues between at least one ex - enatide treatment arm and placebo ( /H9251/H11005 0.05; Fisher’s protected testing proce-dure). Placebo arms C and D were com-bined for all analyses. All inferential statistical tests were conducted at the signiﬁcance level of 0.05(two sided). A general linear model wasused to test for differences in the changefrom baseline to each visit in HbA 1cacross treatments (18,19). Factors in the model included treatment (placebo and two ac-tive treatment arms), strata of baselineHbA 1c(/H110219.0% and /H113509.0%), and study site as ﬁxed effects. Before data analysis,
