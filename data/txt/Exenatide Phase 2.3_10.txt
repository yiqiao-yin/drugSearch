tive study visits or consistently recordedﬁnger-stick fasting blood glucose values/H11022260 mg/dl for at least 2 weeks, not sec- ondary to a readily identiﬁed illness orpharmacological treatment. Study end points Primary objectives were to evaluate glyce-mic control, primarily as assessed byHbA 1c, and safety. Secondary objectives included examining the effects of ex- enatide on fasting plasma glucose concen-trations, body weight, and fastingconcentrations of circulating insulin, pro-insulin, and lipids. Safety end points in-cluded adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, 12-lead elec-trocardiogram, and vital signs. Treat-ment-emergent adverse events weredeﬁned as those occurring upon or afterreceiving the ﬁrst randomized dose. Theemergence of anti-exenatide antibodieswas also assessed. Statistical analysis Randomization was stratiﬁed accordingto screening HbA 1cvalues ( /H110219.0% and /H113509.0%) to achieve a balanced distribu-
