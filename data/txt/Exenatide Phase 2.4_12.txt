withdrew before the last dose because of reasons other than nausea and vomiting were included in the analysis,but were considered as not having completed the study. Fisher’s Exact Test was used to compare the exenatide- primed arm and the exenatide-naive arm with respectto the overall proportion of subjects experiencing severe nausea, nausea leading to withdrawal, and vomiting. The study was designed to provide approximately 80% power to detect a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in the above incidence ( α=0.05) by Day 37 ±1. It was assumed that the proportion of subjects experiencing dose-limiting side effects would be at least 60% in the exenatide-naive arm and no more than 30% in the exenatide-primed arm. Toaccount for early dropout, the Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the overall incidence of the side effects over the course of the entire study. The standard errors (SEM) of the Kaplan–Meier estimates were calculated
