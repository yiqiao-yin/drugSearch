Findings 456 patients underwent randomisation and received at least one dose of the assigned drug (233 given  exenatide, 223 glargine). A t 3 years, least-squares mean HbA1c change was –1·01% (SE 0·07) in the exenatide group  versus –0·81% (0·07) in the glargine group (least-squares mean diﬀ  erence –0·20%, SE 0·10, 95% CI –0·39 to –0·02;  p=0·03). Transient gastrointestinal adverse events characteristic of GLP-1 receptor agonists were more frequent with exenatide than glargine (nausea: 36 [15%] of 233 patients vs ﬁ ve [2%] of 223; vomiting: 15 [6%] vs six [3%]; diarrhoea:
