At 3 years, least-squares mean reduction in FSG was –1·73 mmol/L (SE 0·19) in the exenatide group and –2·65 mmol/L (0·19) in the glargine group (least-squares mean diﬀ  erence 0·93 mmol/L, SE 0·24, 95% CI 0∙45–1∙41; p<0∙001). By week 156, 52 (23%) of 223 participants who received glargine had achieved an FSG concentration of 5·5 mmol/L or less (the titration target in this group). 3-year SMBG proﬁ  les showed slightly lower least-squares mean values in patients given exenatide than in those given glargine, except at 0300 h and before breakfast (ﬁ gure 2C), although between-group diﬀ  erences were not  signiﬁ  cant. 116 (50%) of the 233 patients given exenatide achieved  and sustained HbA 1c control by week 26, compared with
