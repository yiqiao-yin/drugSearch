disease, and the right approach to control hyper-glycaemia for one patient can change over time. Several drugs with varying mechanisms of action can be necessary to intensify therapy. Insulin glargine (henceforth, glargine) is commonly used alongside oral agents as an injectable therapy when glucose control deteriorates. Exenatide—an alternative injectable therapy to an insulin such as glargine—is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. When injected in a longacting extended-release formulation once a week, the drug is gradually released from poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymer microspheres over 10 weeks. 1 Because of the chronic and progressive course of  diabetes, treatment eﬃ   cacy and safety should ideally be tested in the long term. However, most controlled studies for the registration of new drugs are short term (24–30 weeks), as was the case for most trials of exenatide once weekly. 2–6 In the DURATION-1 extension study,7 once-
