Throughout the study, least-squares mean HbA 1c was  lower in patients given exenatide than in those given glargine (ﬁ  gure 2A).  At 3 years, least-squares mean HbA 1c  change was –1·01% (SE 0·07; –11·0 mmol/mol [SE 0·8]) in the exenatide group and –0·81% (SE 0·07; –8·9 mmol/mol [SE 0·8]) in the glargine group (least-squares mean diﬀ  erence –0∙20%, SE 0·10, 95% CI –0·39  to –0·02; p=0·03). In the completer analysis, least-squares mean change was also greater in the exenatide group (–1·09%, SE 0·08; –11·9 mmol/mol, SE 0·9) than in the glargine group (–0·88%, 0·08; –9·6 mmol/mol, 0·9; least-squares mean diﬀ  erence –0·22%, SE 0·09, 95% CI  –0·40 to –0·03; p=0∙02). Results were similar, although not signiﬁ  cant, in a subgroup analysis by background
