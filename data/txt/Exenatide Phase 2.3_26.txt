Subjects who had a detectable anti- exenatide antibody titer at any time dur-ing the study were considered antibodypositive for the purpose of stratifyingtreatment-emergent adverse events. Thepresence of anti-exenatide antibodies(41% at 30 weeks) had no predictive ef-fect on glycemic control or adverseevents. Most subjects with treatment-emergent anti-exenatide antibodies de- veloped low titer antibodies of unknownbiological relevance. CONCLUSIONS — In most individ- uals with type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemiaresults from a failure of /H9252-cell insulin se- cretory capacity to adequately compen-sate for insulin resistance in peripheraltissues (23). Results from the U.K. Pro-spective Diabetes Study (4–6) indicatethat/H9252-cell failure is progressive despite therapy with diet, metformin, sulfonyl-ureas, or insulin. Reductions in HbA 1c have been shown to lower the risk ofmicrovascular complications. Unfortu-nately, glycemic control in this popula-tion is often inadequate, with averageHbA
