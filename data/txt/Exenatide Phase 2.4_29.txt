dose-escalation did not appear to induce tolerance ortachyphylaxis to the potent glucoregulatory activitiesof exenatide. These results demonstrate the value and feasibility of this study design in assessing the possibility of tolerance induction to adverse events, with no apparentloss of therapeutic activity, before initiating pivotal Phase3c l i n i c a lt r i a l s .It is important to keep in mind that the design of this study does not represent a recommendationof the treatment protocol for initiation of exenatide treatment, but simply a proof-of-principle that dose- escalation has the desired effect to reduce the proportionof subjects experiencing nausea. It would be unrealistic to expect patients to adopt such a multistepped dose- escalation scheme. Nevertheless, these data were valuablein designing a dosing scheme for Phase 3 clinical trialsfor exenatide. Indeed, if one assumes that induction of tolerance is related to total drug exposure, one can derive
