experiencing nausea and vomiting in response to exposure to the highestdose of exenatide (27 vs 56% in the exenatide-naive arm; p=0.0018). Kaplan–Meier estimates of cumulative incidence were 0.28 in the exenatide- primed arm, compared with 0.68 in the exenatide-naive arm ( p≤0.001). A sp r e d i c t e db yt h es t u d yd e s i g n ,f e w e r subjects in the exenatide-primed arm reported severe nausea (29%) and vomiting (10%) than those in theexenatide-naive arm (48 and 31%, respectively). In the exenatide-primed arm, fasting serum glucose progressively declined over the ﬁrst 35 days of dosing, but was unchanged in the exenatide-naive arm (placebo phase) duringthe same interval. Conclusion Gradual dose-escalation of exen atide successfully reduced the proportion of subjects experiencing do se-limiting nausea and vomiting, with no loss of glucoregulatory activity, thus demonstrating the value of gradual dose-escalation in mitigating the gastro intestinal side effects of exenatide.
