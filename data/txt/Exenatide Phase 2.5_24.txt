resulted in signiﬁcant reductions frombaseline in A1C, compared with an in-crease in the placebo arm, at week 30(adjusted P/H110210.0001 for pairwise com- parisons). Of ITT subjects at week 30 with base- line A1C /H110227%, 30% (70 of 230 subjects) in the 10-/H9262g exenatide arm and 24% (56of 235 subjects) in the 5- /H9262g exenatide arm reached an A1C /H113497%, and this pro- portion was signiﬁcantly greater than thatobserved in the placebo arm (7% [16 of238 subjects]; P/H110210.0001 for pairwise comparisons). Of subjects evaluable atweek 30 with baseline A1C /H110227% (n /H11005 554), 34% (60 of 179 subjects) in the10-/H9262g exenatide arm and 27% (54 of 197subjects) in the 5- /H9262g exenatide arm reached an A1C /H113497%, and this propor- tion was signiﬁcantly greater than in theplacebo arm (9% [16 of 174 subjects];P/H110210.0001 for pairwise comparisons).
