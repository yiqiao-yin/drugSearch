Across all three treatment arms, therewas a signiﬁcant incidence of hypoglyce-mia, but the vast majority of events weremild or moderate in severity. Occurenceof hypoglycemia appeared to be inﬂu-enced by three factors: background sul-fonylurea dose, exenatide dose, andambient level of glycemia. For example, ahigher incidence of hypoglycemia wasobserved for the MAX group taking thehigher dose of exenatide with an ambientglycemia closer to 7% A1C. Associatedstudies suggest that exenatide’s action isglucose dependent and would thereforepresent minimal hypoglycemic risk. Un-der controlled clamped condition, ex-enatide’s insulinotropic effect on the/H9252-cell is not observed once plasma glu-cose is lowered to /H110113.9 mmol/l (36) Also,
