achieve control (appendix). The exenatide dose did not change throughout the study. After week 48, addition of new glycaemic therapies and adjustment of doses of current concomitant glycaemic therapies (other than those under study) was allowed. In the exenatide group, the dose of oral glucose-lowering therapy increased in 47 of 233 patients (20%), insulin was added in four (2%), and other oral glucose-lowering therapies were added in 27 (12%). In the glargine group, the dose of oral glucose-lowering therapy increased in 14 of 223 patients (6%), another insulin was added in 15 (7%), and other oral glucose-lowering therapies were added in 16 (7%). Most changes to concomitant drugs were recorded at the next visit (week 60), with few occurring after that point. Mean metformin dose was about 2000 mg per day throughout the study
