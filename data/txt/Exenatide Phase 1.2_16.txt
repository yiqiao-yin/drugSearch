mixed-effect model that included terms for sequence, period, and treat-ment as fixed effects and subject-within-sequence as a random effect.Sequence ( i.e.carryover) was tested using the subject-within-sequence error term, and period and treatment were tested using the intrasubjecterror term. The least square means and sem were derived from the ANOVA or mixed-effect model for both AC2993 and placebo treatmentregimens. The critical Pvalue for statistical significance was Pless than 0.05. Unless otherwise specified, data are presented as mean /H11006sem.Kolterman et al. AC2993 Reduces Plasma Glucose J Clin Endocrinol Metab, July 2003, 88(7):3082 â€“3089 3083Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/88/7/3082/2845236 by guest on 17 January 2024
