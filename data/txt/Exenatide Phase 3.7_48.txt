and 1 [0.4%] was an injection-site nodule) than patients receiving pla- cebo (n = 4 [1.7%], of which 1 [0. 4%] was gastrointestinal). Heart rate increased from baseline to week 28 with exenatide QW (mean change, 2.5 bpm) but remained unchanged in the placebo group (0.2 bpm). From baseline to week 28, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Col- laboration equation) decreased slightly in both groups (mean [SD] change, −2.3 [10.9] and −0.6 [9.6] mL/min/1.73 m2with exena- tide QW and placebo, respectively). No meaningful changes wereobserved for other laboratory parameters (Table S8 in File S1). Most exenatide QW-treated patients (76.0%) developed anti- exenatide antibodies at some point ov er the study period (Table S9 in File S1). Clinically relevant HbA1c reductions occurred regardless of antibodypositivity/titre. Injection-site –related AEs were more common among
