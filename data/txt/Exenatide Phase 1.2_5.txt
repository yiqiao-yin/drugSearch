(8–11). Preferably, such therapies should exhibit a uniquemode of action to enable additive or synergistic use withcurrent therapies; produce no weight gain, hypoglycemia, orother limiting or unmanageable side effects; preserve or en-hance /H9252-cell function; and reduce cardiovascular risk factors that lead to morbidity and mortality. AC2993 (synthetic exendin-4; exenatide), a 39-amino acid peptide, potentially exhibits many of these desired features of a new antidiabetic therapy. Antidiabetic actions of AC2993include glucose-dependent enhancement of insulin secretion(12–14); glucose-dependent suppression of inappropriatelyhigh glucagon secretion (15); slowing of gastric emptying(16), which may be paradoxically accelerated in people withdiabetes (17); and reduction of food intake (18, 19). At leastsome of these antidiabetic actions ( e.g.enhancement of in-
