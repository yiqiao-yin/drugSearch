trast, because of the shorter time courseemployed in this study, stepped dose escala-tion was not incorporated. It is, therefore, notsurprising that the overall incidence of nauseaand the withdrawal rate due to nausea for the10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. dose in the present 28-day study was higher than that observed for the Phase 3,long-term (30-week), controlled trials in whichdose escalation was employed. 46–48Consistent with the glucose dependence of exenatide’s in-sulinotropic actions, 13the incidence of hypo- glycemia was low, with only two subjects (bothreceiving 2.5 /H9262g b.i.d.) reporting a hypo- glycemic event. The glucoregulatory and body-weight effects of exenatide were not different between the sub-groups of patients treated with diet and exercisealone versus metformin—each subgroup exhib-ited significant decreases in HbA 1c, FPG, and
