novel incretin mimetic exenatide includeglucose-dependent enhancement of insu-lin secretion, suppression of inappropri-ately high glucagon secretion, andslowing of gastric emptying (15–18,27–30). These effects together may explainthe reduction in postmeal glucose excur-sions observed in the meal challenge testspresented in our report. The ability of ex-enatide to enhance glucose-dependentinsulin secretion may be mediated by ex-enatide binding to the pancreatic GLP-1receptor (31). In animal models of diabe-tes and in insulin secretory cell lines, ex-enatide and GLP-1 reportedly improve/H9252-cell function by increasing the expres-sion of key genes involved in /H9252-cell func- tion, by increasing insulin biosynthesisand processing, and by augmenting /H9252-cell
