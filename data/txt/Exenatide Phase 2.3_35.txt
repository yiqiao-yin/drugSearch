events were mild or moderate and gastro-intestinal in nature. The incidence ofhypoglycemic risk associated with sulfo-nylurea treatment increased with ex-enatide administration as overallglycemic control improved. Long-termuse of exenatide at Ô¨Åxed subcutaneousdoses of 5 and 10 /H9262g b.i.d. appears to have potential for the treatment of pa-tients with type 2 diabetes not adequatelycontrolled with sulfonylurea agents, with41% able to reach and maintain an HbA 1c /H113497% in the 10- /H9262g b.i.d. arm at the end of 30 weeks.
