comparator (insulin) studies of exenatide in combina-  tion with MET, SU, MET + SU, TZD, and TZD +  MET. 3-9 Therefore, in terms of glycemic control, the  effects of exenatide monotherapy appeared to be  comparable to the effects of exenatide plus oral anti-  diabetic agents. Furthermore, the magnitude of the  HbAI~ reductions was notable given the relatively low  mean baseline HbAI~ values in the current study.  Exenatide monotherapy enabled approximately  one third of patients (31%-35%) to achieve an HbAI~  value <6.5% and nearly half of patients (46%-48%)  to achieve an HbAI~ value <7.0% at end point. More-  over, including patients who had an HbAlc value  <7.0% at baseline, over half (55%-58%) of those  who received exenatide had or achieved HbAI~ <7.0%  August 2008 1457
