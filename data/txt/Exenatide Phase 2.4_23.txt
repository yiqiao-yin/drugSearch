lower than that at baseline (115 mg/dL on day 35 versus174 mg/dL on Day 1; p≤0.001). In contrast, no change in fasting serum glucose concentrations was observed in the exenatide-naive arm during the 35-day dosing phasewhen this arm received the placebo.Figure 3. Fasting serum glucose concentrations. In the exe- natide-primed treatment arm, all serum glucose concentrationswere signiﬁcantly lowe r on Days 8, 14, 23, and 35 ( ±1d a ye a c h visit) than on baseline Day 1 ( p<0.001). In the exenatide-naive arm, serum glucose concentrat ions remained relatively con- stant throughout the study. Exenatide-primed arm, ﬁlled circles.Exenatide-naive arm, open squares. Mean ±SEM Body weight There was a signiﬁcantly greater reduction in body weight in the exenatide-primed arm than in the exenatide-naivearm ( p≤0.001). The change in weight was −1.54± 0.25 kg in the exenatide-primed arm and −0.38±0.20 kg in the exenatide-naive arm. Discussion
