or placebo subcutaneously twice daily for 26 weeks. All subjects continued metformin therapy. RESULTS — At week 30, HbA1cchanges from baseline /H11006SE for each group were /H110020.78/H11006 0.10% (10 /H9262g),/H110020.40/H110060.11% (5 /H9262g), and /H110010.08/H110060.10% (placebo; intent to treat; adjusted P/H110210.002). Of evaluable subjects, 46% (10 /H9262g), 32% (5 /H9262g), and 13% (placebo) achieved HbA1c /H113497% ( P/H110210.01 vs. placebo). Exenatide-treated subjects displayed progressive dose-dependent weight loss ( /H110022.8/H110060.5 kg [10 /H9262g],/H110021.6/H110060.4 kg [5 /H9262g];P/H110210.001 vs. placebo). The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature and generally mild to moderate. Inci-dence of mild to moderate hypoglycemia was low and similar across treatment arms, with nosevere hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS — Exenatide was generally well tolerated and reduced HbA 1cwith no
