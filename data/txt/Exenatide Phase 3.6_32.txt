agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (panel). Our ﬁ ndings show that exenatide and liraglutide improved  glycaemic control with associated weight loss. Reduc-tions in HbA 1c and weight loss were greater in the  liraglutide group than in the exenatide group, and gastrointestinal side-eﬀ  ects and withdrawals due to  adverse events were more frequent with liraglutide. We noted no major hypoglycaemia events; however, a similar number of patients in both groups had minor hypo-glycaemia. Adverse events were mild to moderate and mostly gastrointestinal. Patients in both groups had improved patient-reported outcomes. In other head-to-head studies, exenatide and lira glutide  have achieved better glycaemic control than have many other antihyperglycaemic drugs. Compared with maximum-labelled doses of exenatide twice daily, 9,10  sitagliptin, pioglitazone,7 and actively titrated insulin  glargine,8 treatment with exenatide once weekly provided
