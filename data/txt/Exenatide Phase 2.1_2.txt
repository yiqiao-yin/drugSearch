diet/exercise and those treated with metformin. In addition, patients receiving exenatide exhibiteddose-dependent reductions in body weight (0.0 /H110060.3, /H110020.7/H110060.3, /H110020.7/H110060.2, /H110021.4/H110060.3, and /H110021.8/H11006 0.3 kg for placebo and 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. exenatide, respectively; P/H110210.01 for 7.5 and 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. exenatide doses compared with placebo) at Day 28. The most common adverse event was mild-to-moderate nausea that was dose-dependent (seven of 123 patients randomized to exe-natide withdrew from the study because of gastrointestinal effects). Conclusions: Exenatide dose-dependently improved glycemic control and reduced body weight over 28 days in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet/exercise or metformin. 467INTRODUCTION BETA-CELL DYSFUNCTION and the development of insulin resistance are the core deficits in type 2 diabetes.1The administration of one ormore oral antihyperglycemic drugs (OADs) is
