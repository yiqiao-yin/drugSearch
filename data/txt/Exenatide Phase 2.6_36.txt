frequent with subsequent dosing. Lastly,anti-exenatide antibodies were detectedin a subset of patients but this was notassociated with any apparent loss of efﬁ-cacy or increased incidence of immunesystem-associated adverse events. In summary, in patients treated with metformin who are not achieving ade-quate glycemic control, exenatide eliciteda substantial reduction in HbA 1cwith no increase in the incidence of hypoglycemia and was associated with signiﬁcant andsustained weight loss. This combinationof beneﬁcial effects suggests that long-term use of exenatide at subcutaneousdoses of 5 /H9262g and 10 /H9262g twice daily has potential for the treatment of patientswith type 2 diabetes not adequately con-trolled with metformin.
