placebo arms, respectively) and with-drawals due to nausea low (4 of 11 with-drawals [1.8%] in the exenatide arms).Nausea was reported at a higher incidenceduring the initial weeks of therapy (weeks0â€“8) and declined thereafter (Fig. 6).There was no correlation between changein body weight and duration of nausea.Post hoc analysis of nausea and bodyweight change showed a lack of correla-tion between change in body weight andnausea duration (10 /H9262g exenatide: Y/H11005 /H110020.006 X/H110023.538, R 2/H110050.009; 5 /H9262ge x- enatide: Y/H11005/H11001 0.004 X/H110022.182, R2/H11005 0.004; placebo: Y/H11005/H11001 0.002 X/H110020.435, R2/H110050.0002). Moreover, subjects who never experienced nausea also lost weight: /H110022.2/H110060.7 kg (10- /H9262g exenatide arm) and /H110021.4/H110060.4 kg (5- /H9262g exenatide arm). There were no cases of severe hypo- glycemia. The overall incidence of mild tomoderate hypoglycemia was 5.3% (sixsubjects) in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm,
