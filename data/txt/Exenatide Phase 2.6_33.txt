The improvement in the proinsulin- to-insulin ratio noted in the exenatide-treated patients is an indication of abeneﬁcial effect on the /H9252-cell. In addition, the meal challenge data indicate a robustinsulin secretory response to the mealstimulus despite lower fasting and post-prandial glucose concentrations. Moredetailed analysis of pancreatic /H9252-cell func- tion in long-term treatment with ex-enatide will be necessary to bettercharacterize the potential positive effectsof exenatide on the /H9252-cell. These results are consistent with those reported in a similar 30-week pla-cebo-controlled phase III study of the ef-fects of exenatide on glycemic control andsafety in subjects with type 2 diabetes fail-ing to achieve glycemic control with sul-funonylureas (35). In that study, at week30 the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm had signiﬁ- cant placebo-adjusted reductions of/H110021.0% in HbA 1cand/H110021.0 kg in weight. In addition, a reduction in the proinsulin-
