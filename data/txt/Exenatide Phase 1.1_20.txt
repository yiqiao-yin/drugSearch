all doses of exenatide effectivelyblunted the initial rise in postprandi-al plasma glucose, similar to the re-sults in study B, with glucose concen-trations peaking between 30 and45 minutes after the meal (Figure2A). The glucose pharmacodynamicprofiles were similar for all exenatidedoses tested, and all exenatide dosesresulted in significant suppression ofpostprandial glucose excursionscompared with placebo ( p < 0.05). Within 1.5 to  2 hours, plasma glu-cose concentrations in all exenatidegroups decreased to below baseline.In contrast, 5 hours passed beforepostprandial plasma glucose concen-trations decreased to below baselinein the placebo group. In study A, baseline plasma insu- lin concentrations were similar forthe placebo and exenatide groups(Figure 3A). Postprandial plasma in-
