1cimprovement and similar fasting plasma glucose improvement compared with patients treatedwith exenatide once-weekly in the ﬁrst phase of this trial [3]. Inthe cohort of these patients who completed 52 weeks oftreatment, exenatide once-weekly maintained HbA 1cand fasting plasma glucose improvements; however, weightsigniﬁcantly decreased to a value similar to that observed prior to pioglitazone treatment. Markers of cardiovascular risk Consistent with a previous study of exenatide once-weekly [7], patients who received exenatide once-weekly for 52 weeks maintained signiﬁcant systolic blood pressure improvement (/C243 mmHg). Systolic blood pr essure was not signiﬁcantly changed in patients originally r andomised to sitagliptin during the initial 26-week period [3]; how ever, switching to exenatide once-weekly was associated wit h signiﬁcantly reduced systolic blood pressure. Of note, the improvement in systolic bloodpressure was greater in patients with abnormal ( ‡130 mmHg)
