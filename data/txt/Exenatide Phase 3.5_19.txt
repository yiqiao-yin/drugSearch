glucose concentration less than 54 mg/dl (3.0 mmol/liter) before treatment was also classified as major. Minor hypoglycemia wasdefined as events with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemiaaccompanied by a blood glucose concentration less than 54mg/dl (3.0 mmol/liter) before treatment. Results Patient disposition and baseline characteristics Of 252 patients in the ITT population, a total of 81% completed the study (Fig. 1). With the exception of with-drawal of consent (six patients, ExQW; 10 patients, ExBID),reasons for withdrawal were similar between treatmentgroups. Demographic and baseline characteristics were gen-erally evenly distributed among treatment groups (Table 1). Background antidiabetic therapy regimens encom-passed the range of treatments commonly observed inpatients with type 2 diabetes, beginning at initial diag- nosis (diet and exercise modification) through long-term management (combination therapy) but before ini-tiation of insulin therapy.
