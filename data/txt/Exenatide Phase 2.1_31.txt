body weight compared with their correspond-ing placebo group by 28 days. In addition, theincidence of nausea did not appear to differ sub-stantially between the two subgroups. Thesedata suggest that the effects of exenatide are sim-ilar in patients that have previously been treatedwith OADs and patients that have received onlydiet and exercise modification. The current study was too short to observe the full effects of exenatide on HbA 1c, and it is difficult to extrapolate the results describedherein to predict the long-term effects and/or dose dependencies of exenatide. However, theresults observed after 4 weeks of therapy in thePhase 3, long-term, controlled trials of exe-natide are highly consistent with those ob-served in this 28-day trial and with reductionsin HbA 1cobserved in another 28-day trial with exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes.9For example, when comparing patients at the 5.0/H9262g b.i.d. dose for the present trial to the long-
