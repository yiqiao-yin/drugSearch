Exenatide QW also reduced FPG vs placebo (LSM difference, −0.53 mmol/L [ −9.5 mg/dL]; 95% CI, −0.99 to −0.06 mmol/L [ −17.9 to−1.0 mg/dL]; nominal P= .028; final FPG, 7.43 mmol/L [133.8 mg/dL] and 7.87 mmol/L [141.6 mg/dL], respectively) (Table 2, Figure 2D). FPG reductions were apparent from week 2 (Figure 2D) and were maintained over the 28-week treatment period. At week28, exenatide QW was associated with a numerically larger decreasein mean 6-point self-monitored blood glucose vs placebo at all points,with the exception of before breakfast (Figure S2 in File S1). No significant difference was observed between groups for change in daily IG dose from baseline to week 28 (LSM difference, −2.0 units; 95% CI, −4.1 to +0.1; nominal P=.068) (Table 2). In both groups, there was a small increase from baseline in the daily IG doseup to week 2, followed by stabilization through week 28 (Figure 2E).Use of rescue therapy did not differ between the exenatide QW
