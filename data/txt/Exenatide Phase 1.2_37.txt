effect because of lower circulating concentrations of AC2993.Because of the multiple acute glucose-lowering actions ofAC2993 operative in the postprandial period, it is not pos-sible to ascertain the net individual contribution of glucose-dependent insulinotropism, suppression of glucagon secre-tion, or slowing of gastric emptying on postprandial glucosecontrol. In contrast to the fasting state, postprandial insulinconcentrations were actually lower after AC2993 treatment,compared with placebo (Fig. 3). However, relative to theextent of reduced glucose concentrations (Fig. 1), postpran-dial insulinemia may, in fact, be enhanced. Thus, glucose-dependent insulinotropism appears to be an importantmechanism for reduction of both fasting and postprandialglucose concentrations. Glucagon concentrations were reduced by AC2993 in both the fasting and postprandial states (Fig. 4). This observation
