adverse events, vital signs, and anti-exenatide antibodies (low titre: <1/625; high titre: ≥1/625; assessed at weeks 8, 14, 26, 48, 108, and 156 in the exenatide group only). Safety data were monitored throughout the course of the study by the Lilly clinical research physician and by investigators. Statistical analyses Analyses were done in SAS (version 9.1.3). The sample size was calculated for the 26-week outcome. A sample size of 205 patients per treatment group was needed to achieve 92% power to detect a diﬀ  erence in HbA 1c of  0·4% (4·4 mmol/mol) from baseline (two-sided t  test,  signiﬁ  cance level 0·05, common SD 1·2%  [13·1 mmol/mol]).16 Eﬃ  cacy analyses were by modiﬁ  ed  intention to treat (mITT), including patients given at least one dose of the assigned drug. Patients in the mITT population who completed treatment to 156 weeks and had an HbA 1c value at 156 weeks were included in a
