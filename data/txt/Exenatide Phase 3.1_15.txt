time course and durability of A1C im-provements were similar for the ITT pop-ulation and 52-week evaluablepopulation (Fig. 2 B). Patients who switched from exenatide BID to exenatideQW (week 30 A1C reduction /H110021.8% [/H110021.9 to/H110021.6%]) exhibited further im- provements in glycemic control such thatthey achieved the same A1C reduction(/H110022.0%) and mean A1C (6.6%) at week 52 as patients receiving only exenatideQW. After 52 weeks of treatment, 71% ofall patients achieved A1C /H110217.0% and 54% achieved A1C /H113496.5% (similar be- tween cohorts) (Fig. 2 D). In patients with a baseline A1C /H110219.0% (baseline A1C 7.8%), A1C reduction at week 52 was /H110021.2%Exenatide once weekly, 52-week safety and efÔ¨Åcacy 1256 DIABETES CARE,VOLUME 33, NUMBER 6, J UNE2010 care.diabetesjournals.orgDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/6/1255/605969/zdc0061000 255.pdf by guest on 17 January 2024
