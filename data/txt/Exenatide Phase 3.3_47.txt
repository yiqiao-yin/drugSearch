patients have an attenuated mean HbA 1c response  (–0·6% [–6·6 mmol/mol]).26 In previous exenatide  studies,2,3,5,6,24 antibody-positive patients also had similar  incidences of adverse events to antibody-negative patients, apart from injection-site reactions. Implementation of the insulin titration protocol with  SMBG meant that clinical judgment had to be used, which could have aﬀ  ected study results, including the HbA 1c diﬀ  erence between treatment groups.  Individualisation of therapy was allowed, which means that patients’ concerns about insulin-associated hypoglycaemia (especially for patients close to target or using concomitant sulfonylureas, or both) and weight gain could have led to less aggressive titration. Because the insulin dose was titrated with SMBG, evaluation of FSG from site visits does not fully reﬂ  ect achievement  of glucose targets. It is reassuring that glargine doses were increased in patients who had not achieved HbA 1c
