circulates after ingestion of a meal (25),and may have endocrine functions re-lated to metabolic control. Exendin-4has a 53% amino acid sequence overlapwith mammalian GLP-1. However, ex-endin-4 is the product of a separategene distinct from the proglucagon genefrom which GLP-1 is expressed (26).Unlike GLP-1, which is degradedwithin 1–2 min by dipeptidyl pepti-dase-IV (DPP-IV) when administeredSC, exendin-4 is resistant to DPP-IVdegradation and, thus, is more readilyavailable for exerting beneﬁcial meta-bolic effects similar to those of GLP-1(27). These properties confer uponAC2993 (synthetic exendin-4, ex-enatide) a very high ( /H110221,000-fold) in vivo potency relative to GLP-1 (10,28).However, not all actions of exendin-4are predictable based on the known pharmacology of GLP-1. For example,GLP-1, but not exendin-4, suppresses gas- tric acid secretion (29). Moreover, whileintraportal GLP-1 infusion triggers thehepatic vagal afferents, exendin-4 doesnot (30).
