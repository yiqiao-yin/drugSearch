exenatide administered in combination with oral an-  tidiabetic agents was also reported to be associated  with improvements in blood pressure and lipid pro-  files (systolic blood pressure,-3.5 mm Hg; diastolic  blood pressure, -3.3 mm Hg; total cholesterol [TC],  -10.8 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  [LDL-C], -11.8 mg/dL; and high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol [HDL-C], +8.5 mg/dL). 11  Based on those results, 3-9,11 evaluation of exenatide  as monotherapy in antidiabetic drug-naive patients  with type 2 diabetes may be of clinical interest. Two  previous 4-week, placebo-controlled studies included  138 patients receiving no background antidiabetic  agents. 12,13 One concluded with a 30-week open-label  extension that included 30 patients receiving no back-  ground antidiabetic agents. Both studies evaluated the  efficacy and tolerability of exenatide monotherapy at  a dosage of 2.5 to 10 gg BID or 10 or 20 gg QD in
