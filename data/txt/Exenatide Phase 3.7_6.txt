tional benefits of weight loss and low hypoglycaemia risk. Among patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite basal insulin, real-world data indicate that treatment is often not intensi-fied, either by continued uptitration of basal insulin or by addition ofprandial insulin. 20,21The reasons are multifactorial, including concerns about hypoglycaemia and weight gain, requirement for frequentblood glucose self-monitoring and clinic visits, and patient dislike ofmultiple daily injections. Adding exenatide, the first in class GLP-1RA,twice daily (BID) improves glycaemic control without increased hypo-glycaemia or weight gain among patients with uncontrolled T2DMreceiving basal insulin. 6However, patients may wish to further reduce injection burden by adding a once-weekly (QW) GLP-1RA22,23 or a fixed-ratio basal insulin and GLP-1RA combination.24,25Exena- tide QW, which has good gastrointestinal tolerability,26probably
