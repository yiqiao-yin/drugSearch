For subjects with anti-AC2993 antibodies at any timeduring the study, t 1/2was 125 /H1100642 min on day 1 and 373 /H11006250 min on day 28 with corresponding Cmaxvalues of 172 /H11006 57 and 357 /H11006215 pg/ml, respectively (n/H1100518 for all AC2993 arms combined). Vital signs and clinical laboratory assessmentsNo notable differences were observed forthe change in vital signs (blood pressureand heart rate) from day –1 to day 28among any treatment groups, which in-cluded a substantial proportion of pa-tients ( /H1101150%) receiving concomitant medications for preexisting hypertension.No patient withdrew prematurely fromthe study due to a vital sign abnormality. There were no clinically relevant changes in hematology, clinical chemis-try, or urinalysis analyte values from day–1 to day 28 in any of the treatmentgroups. There were no statistically signiﬁcant
