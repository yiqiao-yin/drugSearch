exenatide antibody status, suggests that, for exenatide QW, both in vivo degradation of microspheres and immune responses to exena-tide contribute. This study adds to evidence supporting the addition of a GLP- 1RA for patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite basalinsulin. 3Previous studies with the short-acting GLP-1RA exenatide BID added to basal insulin6,8demonstrated glycaemic improvements, body weight loss and a low hypoglycaemia risk, as have studies withthe QD GLP-1RAs lixisenatide 7,9,10and liraglutide added to basal insulin.11Furthermore, fixed-ratio combinations of IG plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) and insulin degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira) significantly decrease HbA1c and body weight, compared with their respectivebasal insulin monocomponents, without increasing hypoglycaemia risk. 24,25Fixed-ratio combinations may not be suitable for patients requiring greater doses of basal insulin. To date, 2 other studies (HARMONY-6 and AWARD-9) have
