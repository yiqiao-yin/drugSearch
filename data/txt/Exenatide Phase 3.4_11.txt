Analyses of patient-reported out- comes were performed without adjustment for multiple statistical testing. The original primary analysis excluded unscheduled postbaseline observations for unexpected early discontinuations; therefore, a modi ﬁed analysis was com- pleted, including all postbaseline observa- tions. This modi ﬁed MMRM analysis was performed after database lock when it wasdetermined that the original analysis ex- cluded patients who discontinued before week 8. All statistical analyses were per-formed using SAS Version 9.1 (SAS In-stitute, Cary, NC). RESULTSPatients Of 820 intent-to-treat patients, 696(84.9%) completed the 26-week treat- ment period and 736 (89.8%) returned for 10-week safety follow-up (Fig. 1). Patientcharacteristics at baseline were similar
