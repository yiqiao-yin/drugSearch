by increasing the expression of key genesinvolved in insulin secretion, by increas-ing insulin biosynthesis, and by augment-ing/H9252-cell mass through multiple mechanisms (9,28). Data obtained in an-imal models (9,10,28,29) also indicatethat exenatide and GLP-1 reduce food in-take, cause weight loss, and have an insu-lin-sensitizing effect. The data from the current trial dem- onstrate that long-term use of exenatide atﬁxed doses of 5 and 10 /H9262g b.i.d. dose dependently improve overall glycemia(HbA 1c) in patients failing sulfonylurea therapy. Previous studies have docu- mented how other therapies (i.e., acar-bose, metformin, or thiazolidinediones),when added to a background of sulfonyl-urea, also elicit a glucose-lowering effect.It is difﬁcult to draw comparisons withthis current data because the majority ofsuch studies (30–35) have observed drugeffects in patients with worse glycemiccontrol, hence much higher baselineHbA 1clevels, where HbA1clowering oc -
