in the ITT population. Compared with ExBID, a signifi-cantly greater number of ExQW patients achieved theHbA1c targets of less than 7.0% (adjusted P/H110210.0001) and 6.5% or less ( P/H110210.0001) at wk 24 (Fig. 2B). In the subgroup of patients with baseline HbA1c less than 9%(n/H11005178), LS mean reductions in HbA1c from baseline to wk 24 were /H110021.2% and /H110020.5% in the ExQW and ExBID groups, respectively (treatment difference P/H110210.001). Larger decreases in HbA1c were achieved in patients withbaseline HbA1c of 9% or greater (n /H1100572), in which a /H110021.9% LS mean reduction in HbA1c was observed with ExQW compared with a /H110021.3% reduction with ExBID. Significant decreases in FPG were evident at wk 4 in bothgroups, with ExQW producing a significantly greaterchange in FPG from baseline to wk 24 [ /H1100235/H110065 mg/dl (/H110021.9/H110060.3 mmol/liter)] than ExBID [ /H1100212/H110065 mg/dl (/H110020.7/H110060.3 mmol/liter); treatment difference adjusted
