percent of ITT subjects were treated withan ACE inhibitor, 38% with an anti-thrombotic agent, and 53% with a serumlipid–reducing agent. A1C and plasma glucose There was a modest decline in A1C valuesin all treatment arms during the placeborun-in period and the initial 2 weeks ofthe study after randomization (ITT popu-lation; Fig. 2). Thereafter, A1C values inthe exenatide arms continued to declinefor another 12 weeks of observation,while A1C values in the placebo arm re-mained stable and then gradually in-creased such that these values returned tobaseline by the end of the study. Ex-enatide treatment arms had signiﬁcant re-ductions in A1C from baseline comparedwith placebo (P /H110210.0001; Fig. 1A). When stratiﬁed by baseline A1C /H113509%, signiﬁcant reductions in A1C frombaseline in each exenatide arm comparedwith placebo were observed (adjustedP/H113490.0002 for pairwise comparisons). Similarly, for subjects with baseline A1C/H110219%, exenatide treatment at 5 or 10 /H9262g
