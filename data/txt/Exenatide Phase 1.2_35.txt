suppression of glucagon secretion (15), and slowing of gas-tric emptying (16) are principal acute actions. The longer-term actions of AC2993 include weight reduction (22), en-hanced insulin sensitivity (22), and increased /H9252-cell mass (25, 27). Chief among the acute actions is glucose-dependent in-sulinotropism, i.e.the amplification of /H9252-cell insulin release when glucose concentrations are above the normal range butnot when glucose concentrations are below the normal range(13, 14). The end result of glucose-dependent insulinotro-pism is to increase the gain of glucose-insulin secretion cou-pling while maintaining the physiologic glucose-sensingcontrol mechanisms. This action of AC2993 contrasts withthe action of available insulin secretagogues or hypoglyce-mic agents, such as sulfonylureas, which increase insulinsecretion regardless of the glucose concentration (38) andthus have the potential to induce hypoglycemia (5). The glucose-dependent insulinotropism exhibited by
