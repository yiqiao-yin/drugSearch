Purpose.  The pharmacology and tolerabili- ty of exenatide in patients with type 2 dia- betes mellitus were studied. Methods.  Two randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conduct- ed. Treatment with oral antidiabetic agents was stopped 14 days before study initia- tion. In the first study (study A), eight sub- jects received placebo, 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.3-, and either 0.4- µg/kg exenatide or placebo five minutes before a meal combined with liq- uid acetaminophen (to assess the rate of gastric emptying) on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. In the second study (study B), subjects re- ceived a single s.c. dose of exenatide or pla- cebo on consecutive days. Part 1 of study B used exenatide doses of 0.01 and 0.1 µg/ kg; 0.02-, 0.05-, and 0.1- µg/kg doses were given in part 2. After an overnight fast, the study drug was injected 15 minutes be- fore a meal (part 1) and before a meal and acetaminophen (part 2). Parts 1 and 2 of study B enrolled six and eight patients, respectively.
