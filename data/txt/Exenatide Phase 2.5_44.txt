not associated with the weight gain ordi-narily seen with the glycemic improve-ment achieved by other therapies(6,8,10,11), even though no program ofbehavior modiÔ¨Åcation was included inthe protocol. The progressive weight lossobserved is consistent with the known ac-tion of exenatide to reduce food intake(29,32). The most common adverse eventassociated with exenatide treatment wasdose-dependent mild to moderate nau-sea. Nausea was reported most commonlyduring the initial 8 weeks of therapy andwas reported less frequently as the studyprogressed. Although nausea was re-ported most frequently in the initialweeks after starting therapy, weight losswas progressive over 30 weeks, thus sup-porting the dissociation of the two effects.
