agonist is an analogue of human GLP-1, with one aminoacid substitution (Arg34Lys) and a C-16 palmitic acid side chain attached via a glutamyl spacer, resulting in slow absorption and resistance to inactivation by DPP-4. Liraglutide is 99% bound to albumin; free liraglutide is degraded by endogenous peptidases. Liraglutide has a half-life of 13 h, reaching maximum concentrations within 10–14 h after administration, and is eliminated by metabolism without a speciﬁ  c organ route. 19 Studies have
