reported at a higher incidence during theinitial weeks of therapy (weeks 0â€“8) anddeclined thereafter (Fig. 4). There was nocorrelation between change in body weightand duration of nausea. Post hoc analysis ofnausea and body weight change showed alack of correlation between change inbody weight and nausea duration (10 /H9262g exenatide: Y/H11005/H110020.013/H11003/H110021.625; R 2/H11005 0.056; 5 /H9262g exenatide: Y/H11005/H11002 0.003/H11003 /H110021.273; R2/H110050.003; placebo: Y/H11005 0.013/H11003/H11002 1.596; R2/H110050.028). Subjects who never experienced nausea still lostweight: /H110021.1/H110060.3 kg (10-/H9262g arm) and /H110021.7/H110060.2 kg (5-/H9262g arm). The overall incidence of hypoglyce- mia was higher in each exenatide treat-ment arm compared with the placebo arm(Table 1). One case of hypoglycemia re-quiring assistance from another individ-ual (severe hypoglycemia), but no medi-cal intervention, occurred in the 5- /H9262g arm.
