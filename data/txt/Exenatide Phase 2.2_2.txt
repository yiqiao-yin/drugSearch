this study, it had signiﬁcant effects on HbA 1clevels in patients not currently achieving optimal glucose control with diet and/or OAAs. Diabetes Care 26:2370–2377, 2003 The natural history of type 2 diabetes is characterized by the emergence ofpostprandial and, subsequently, fasting hyperglycemia (1). In most indi-viduals, hyperglycemia results from a fail- ure of/H9252-cell insulin-secretory capacity to adequately compensate for insulin resis-tance in peripheral tissues (2). Resultsfrom the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) indicate that /H9252-cell failure is progressive, despite therapy with diet, in-sulin, sulfonylurea, or metformin (3,4). Inaddition, a reduction in glycosylated he-moglobin A 1c(HbA1c) lowered the risk of vascular complications, suggesting that any reduction in HbA1cmay be beneﬁcial to subjects with type 2 diabetes. As /H9252-cell
