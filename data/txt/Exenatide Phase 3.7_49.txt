patients with anti-exenatide antibodies (7.3% vs 0.4% with negative anti- body status), with most occurrences in the low-positive titre group. 4|DISCUSSION For patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled despite basal insulin /C6metformin, treatment options include uptitration ofthe basal insulin dose or, if unsuccessful, the addition of another injectable or oral (SGLT2i4,5or DPP-4i4) drug.3–5Injectable additions include a BID, once-daily (QD), or QW GLP-1RA or prandial insulin (starting QD and increasing progressively to 3 times a day).3–5The clinical benefits of adding a QW GLP-1RA (similar or better glycaemiccontrol, weight loss and fewer hypoglycaemic episodes vs prandialinsulin) to basal insulin make this combination an attractiveoption. 18,19 In the current study, exenatide QW + IG was well tolerated, sig-
