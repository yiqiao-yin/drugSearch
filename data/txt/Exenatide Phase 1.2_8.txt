prandial and fasting glucose-lowering effect of AC2993 inindividuals with type 2 diabetes. To fully explore the glucose-lowering potential of AC2993, one study examining post-prandial glucose control was conducted across groups ex-hibiting a range of disease severity based on current therapyeither with diet management alone, OAA, or insulin with orwithout OAA. The second study was conducted to evaluatethe effect of AC2993 on fasting glucose concentrations. Someof the data presented here have been previously reported inabstract form (29 –31). Subjects and Methods Subjects Eligible subjects for each study were required to have type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with diet management, any OAA, or insulin with orwithout OAA (study A only). OAA regimens were to have been stablefor at least 6 months (study A) or 3 months (study B) before screening.Subjects were to be 18 –65 yr of age; male or if female, postmenopausal or surgically sterile. In addition, subjects were to have HbA 1c12% or
