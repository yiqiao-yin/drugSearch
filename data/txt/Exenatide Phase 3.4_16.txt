SMBG; however, EQW was associatedwith greater mean reductions at all time points compared with SITA. Mean reduc- tions in SMBG postmeal excursions after26 weeks were similar among all treat- ment groups. LS mean baseline weight values ranged from 85.9 to 88.6 kg. Weight decreased with EQW, MET, and SITA treatment, but increased with PIO treat-ment (Fig. 2 C). Weight changes weresigniﬁcantly different between EQW ver- sus PIO and SITA starting at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, and continued through 26 weeks (all P#0.003). At 26 weeks, LS mean (SE) body weight changes were22.0 kg (0.2 kg) with EQW; 22.0 kg (0.2 kg) with MET ( P= 0.892 vs. EQW); +1.5 kg (0.3 kg) with PIO ( P,0.001 vs. EQW); and 20.8 kg (0.3 kg) with SITA ( P,0.001 vs. EQW). The percentage of patients with re- ductions in both body weight and HbA 1c was similar for EQW and MET; percentages were comparably lower with PIO and SITA (Supplementary Figs. 2 A–D).
