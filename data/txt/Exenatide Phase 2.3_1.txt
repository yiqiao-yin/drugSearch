breakfast and dinner; arms A and B) or placebo. Subsequently, subjects in arm B were escalatedto 10/H9262g b.i.d. exenatide. All subjects continued sulfonylurea therapy. RESULTS â€” At week 30, HbA 1cchanges from baseline were /H110020.86/H110060.11,/H110020.46/H110060.12, and 0.12 /H110060.09% ( /H11006SE) in the 10- /H9262g, 5-/H9262g, and placebo arms, respectively (adjusted P/H11021 0.001). Of evaluable subjects with baseline HbA1c/H110227% ( n/H11005237), 41% (10 /H9262g), 33% (5 /H9262g), and 9% (placebo) achieved HbA1c/H113497% ( P/H110210.001). Fasting plasma glucose concentrations decreased in the 10- /H9262g arm compared with placebo ( P/H110210.05). Subjects in the exenatide arms had dose-dependent progressive weight loss, with an end-of-study loss in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm of/H110021.6/H110060.3 kg from baseline ( P/H110210.05 vs. placebo).
