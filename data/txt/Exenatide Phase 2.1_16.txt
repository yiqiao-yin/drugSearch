75% (117 subjects) were treated with metformin versus 25% (39 subjects) with diet and exercisealone. Effects of exenatide at Day 28 Mean changes in HbA 1c, FPG, and body weight from baseline to Day 28 are shown inFigure 1. Exenatide was associated with statis-tically significant dose-dependent reductionsin HbA 1cafter 28 days of treatment ( P/H110210.0001, for testing the linear contrast). Reductions weresignificantly greater than with placebo at eachexenatide dose studied (Fig. 1A). FPG concen-trations in exenatide groups were significantlyreduced compared with placebo for each exe-natide dose (Fig. 1B); however, the magnitudeof the effect did not appear to be dose depen-dent. The statistical testing of the linear con-trast yielded a significant Pvalue ( P/H110050.0006),
