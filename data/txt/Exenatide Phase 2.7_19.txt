based mixed effects model ss was employed, including  treatment, screening HbAI~ subgroup, week of visit,  treatment-by-week of visit interaction, and baseline  values of the dependent variable as covariates. Treat-  ment comparisons for the percentages of patients who  had or achieved HbAI~ _<6.5% and _<7.0% at end  point were made using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test s3 adjusting for HbAI~ subgroup. In this study, the  HOMA-B data were logarithmically transformed to  satisfy the normality assumption; thus, geometric  mean values are reported. Treatment comparisons for the incidences of  treatment-emergent adverse events (including hypo-  glycemia) were made using the Fisher exact test. s3  Hypoglycemia rates per patient per year were com-  pared using Poisson regression analysis s3 with treat-  ment included in the model.  All data are presented for the intent-to-treat (ITT)  sample, which included all randomized patients who
