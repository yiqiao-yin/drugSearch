The study commenced with a4-week, single-blind, lead-in period withinjection of placebo twice daily. Thereaf-ter, subjects were randomized to one offour treatment arms. As nausea had beenthe most frequent adverse event in earlierclinical trials (21) and gradual dose esca-lation attenuated this side effect, the cur-rent study included an acclimation periodof 4 weeks at a lower ﬁxed dose of ex-enatide (5 /H9262g b.i.d.) in the active treat- ment arms (A and B) before the ﬁxed doseof exenatide was either increased to 10 /H9262g b.i.d. (arm B) or left at 5 /H9262g b.i.d. (arm A)
