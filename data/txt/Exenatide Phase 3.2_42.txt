overall high-sensitivity C-reactive protein improvements in theother two cohorts are unclear but may be related to the similardifferences in HDL cholesterol change between these treatmentarms (HDL cholesterol has been suggested to be the primary lipidassociated with high-se nsitivity C-reactive protein elevation [13]; Table 1). Further studies are warr anted to elucidate the effects of exenatide once-weekly on these cardiovascular risk markers,particularly in patients with abnormal values. Safety and tolerability As in previous trials with ex enatide, mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were t he primary adverse events. Of note, patients who received exe natide once-weekly during the initial 26-week treatment period experienced a lower rate ofnausea compared with patients who switched (5 vs. 10â€“11%),presumably because of prior exe natide exposure.
