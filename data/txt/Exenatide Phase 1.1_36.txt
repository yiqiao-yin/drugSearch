utes (mean ± S.D.) that appeared to be limited by absorption rate.25 In the current studies, doses of exenatide0.02  µg/kg or higher reduced post- prandial glucose excursion, thus defin-ing the mi nimally effective exenatide dose for this action in humans. Plas-ma glucose was dose-dependentlylowered by s.c. exenatide administra-tion during the crucial two hours af-ter a meal. These observations extendthose reported previously that indi-cate that exenatide reduces plasmaglucose concentrations in the post-prandial state in patients with type 2diabetes mellitus. 28 Exena tide has been reported to exhibit a number of acute andchronic actions in animal modelsof diabetes that may account for the glucose-lowering effects observed inhumans. 14 Glucose-dependent in-
