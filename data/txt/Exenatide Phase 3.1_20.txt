(supplementary Fig. 2, available in an online appendix). Glucose control during transition from exenatide BID to exenatide QWIn patients who received exenatide QWfor 52 weeks, least squares mean (95%CI) reductions in FPG at week 30 ( /H1100246 mg/dl [/H1100252 to/H1100240 mg/dl]) were main- tained through week 52 ( /H1100247 mg/dl [/H1100253 to/H1100241 mg/dl]) (Fig. 2 C). Patients who switched from exenatide BID to ex-enatide QW achieved a similar reductionin FPG at week 52 ( /H1100243 mg/dl [ /H1100249 to /H1100237 mg/dl]) (Fig. 2 C) relative to patients who received exenatide QW for 52weeks. Subsequent to week 30, BID-treated patients who switched to ex-enatide QW experienced a transient risein mean FPG concentration followed by arapid decrease within 2 weeks of theswitch (Fig. 2 C).
