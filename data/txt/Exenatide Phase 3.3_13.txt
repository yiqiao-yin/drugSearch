completer analysis if a baseline value and at least one post-baseline value of the response variable were available. We did a maximum likelihood-based, mixed-model repeated-measures ANCOVA, with treatment, baseline value of dependent variable, country, con-comitant oral glucose-lowering therapy stratum, week of visit, and treatment-by-week interaction as ﬁ  xed eﬀ  ects,  and patient and error as random eﬀ  ects. Least-squares  mean estimates and SEs of the within-treatment (last measurement minus baseline) and between-treatment (exenatide minus glargine) diﬀ  erence were obtained from  the model; inferences were based on the estimate at week 156. For tests of between-treatment diﬀ  erences, we used a  two-sided signiﬁ  cance level of 0·05 unless otherwise  indicated. We used Fisher’s exact test to compare categorical variables. Exposure-adjusted event rate of overall hypoglycaemia was calculated as the total number  See Online for appendix
