Glycemic control parameters and body weight Patients treated with ExQW demonstrated an improve- ment in HbA1c by wk 4 of treatment, with a significantlygreater improvement compared with ExBID observedfrom wk 8 through wk 24 (Fig. 2A). At wk 24, the LSmean/H11006 SEchange in HbA1c from baseline was /H110021.6/H11006 0.1% in ExQW and /H110020.9/H110060.1% in ExBID patients (ITT; P/H110210.0001), resulting in a treatment difference of /H110020.7% (/H110020.9,/H110020.4). LS mean /H11006SEchanges from baseline to wk 24 in the evaluable population were identical with those inthe ITT population. Mixed-effects model repeated-mea-sure sensitivity analysis provided similar results ( /H110021.5/H11006 0.1% in ExQW patients and /H110020.8/H110060.1% in ExBID pa- tients, P/H110210.0001). At wk 24, the mean /H11006 SEHbA1c was 7.1/H110060.1% for ExQW and 7.7 /H110060.1% for ExBID patients
