weight gain and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control with metformin. Diabetes Care 28:1092â€“1100, 2005 In most individuals with type 2 diabe- tes, hyperglycemia results from a fail-ure of insulin secretion from the /H9252-cells to adequately compensate for insulin re-sistance in peripheral tissues (1). Resultsfrom the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) indicate that /H9252-cell failure is a progressive phenomenon and probablyexplains why the therapeutic need in-creases with time despite therapy withdiet, metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin (2,3). Although reductions in HbA 1c lower the risk of vascular complications,glycemic control is often inadequate withaverage HbA 1cvalues well above 8% (4,5). Moreover, many available thera- peutic agents have undesirable side effects(such as weight gain, hypoglycemia, andedema) that can impede the attainment ofglycemic control and discourage patientcompliance (6,7).
