5 d during consecutive treatment periods separated by a 2- to 3-dinterim. Each treatment (0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993 or placebo) was injected sc BID, before breakfast and dinner. Subjects were discharged from theinpatient unit during the interim period and no study treatment wasgiven. The treatment sequence ( i.e.placebo, followed by 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993, or 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993, followed by placebo) was assigned randomly. Subjects were randomized within each diabetes severitygroup (described above) to achieve balanced treatment sequences within each population. Following an overnight fast, baseline evaluations of plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma glucagon were performed before studymedication injection o n d 1 and 5. Ten minutes following injection,
