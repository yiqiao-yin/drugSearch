mean (SE); change from baseline data are geometric least-squares mean ratio of week 156 to baseline (95% CI); and mean diﬀ  erence data are the ratio of exenatide to glargine. Dependent variables and their  baselines have been logarithmically transformed. ‡Detected with high-sensitivity test. §Data are descriptive mean (SD) at baseline and change from baseline at treatment endpoint (last observation carried forward); no statistical comparisons were done for these safety endpoints.
