niﬁcance of 0.05 and common SD of 1.2%) (6). A prede ﬁned noninferiority margin of 0.3% and sample size of 444 patients would provide 74% power to test the noninferiority of EQW versusMET, and a sample size of 370 would pro-vide 65% power to test the noninferiority of EQW versus PIO (and SITA).Patients A total of 820 patients in 22 countries participated between November 2008 and June 2010. Adults with type 2 diabetes metthe following inclusion criteria: HbA 1c 7.1–11.0%, BMI 23 –45 kg/m2, and history of stable weight. Patients were excluded iftreated with any antihyperglycemic drug for.7 days within 3 months of screening. Antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medi-cation changes were only made if medically required. Study design Randomization was determined by computer-generated random sequence using an interactive voice response system.Treatment assignments were strati ﬁed by country. MET and PIO dosages were in-
