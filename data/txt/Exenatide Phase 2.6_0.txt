B ARON,MD3 OBJECTIVE — This study evaluates the ability of the incretin mimetic exenatide (exendin-4) to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic controlwith maximally effective metformin doses. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A triple-blind, placebo-controlled, 30-week study at 82 U.S. sites was performed with 336 randomized patients. In all, 272 patients com-pleted the study. The intent-to-treat population baseline was 53 /H1100610 years with BMI of 34.2 /H11006 5.9 kg/m 2and HbA1cof 8.2/H110061.1%. After 4 weeks of placebo, subjects self-administered 5 /H9262g exenatide or placebo subcutaneously twice daily for 4 weeks followed by 5 or 10 /H9262g exenatide,
