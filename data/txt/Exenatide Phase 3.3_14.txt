The 95% CIs were then calculated by the exact method on the basis of the Poisson distribution. We used descriptive statistics in subgroup analysis by  baseline HbA 1c and last observation carried forward  ANCOVA in subgroup analysis by background glucose-lowering therapy. In a post-hoc analysis, we assessed achievement of sustained HbA 1c control with exenatide  versus glargine. Loss of or inability to achieve HbA1c  control was deﬁ  ned as HbA1c of more than 7·0%  (53 mmol/mol) at two consecutive visits (10–12 weeks apart) during the extension period or one measurement of more than 9·0% (75 mmol/mol) after 26 weeks’ treatment. Patients in the mITT population for whom post-baseline HbA 1c data were not available were counted
