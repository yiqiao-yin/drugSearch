MET and PIO therapies were increased to maximum-tolerated dosages. Injections with EQW or placebo were administered weekly, while oral medication or placebo was administered daily. RESULTS dBaseline characteristics were as follows: 59% men, 67% Caucasian, mean age 54 years, HbA 1c8.5%, fasting serum glucose 9.9 mmol/L, body weight 87.0 kg, and diabetes du- ration 2.7 years. HbA 1creductions (%) at 26 weeks (least-squares means) with EQW versus MET, PIO, and SITA were 21.53 vs. 21.48 ( P=0 . 6 2 0 ) , 21.63 ( P= 0.328), and 21.15 ( P,0.001), respectively. Weight changes (kg) were 22.0 vs.22.0 ( P= 0.892), +1.5 ( P,0.001), and 20.8 (P,0.001), respectively. Common adverse events were as follows: EQW, nausea (11.3%) and diarrhea (10.9%); MET, diarrhea (12.6%) and headache (12.2%); PIO, nasopharyngitis (8.6%) and headache (8.0%); and SIT, nasopharyngit is (9.8%) and headache (9.2%). Minor (con- Ô¨Årmed) hypoglycemia was rarely reported. No major hypoglycemia occurred.
