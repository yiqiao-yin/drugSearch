using Greenwood’s formula [10]. Owing to variabilityassociated with the ±1-day window around study visits, analyses were performed on study data up to Day 43.Change in body weight and serum glucose concentrations were evaluated using ANOVA. Assays Serum glucose concentrations were quantitated byEsoterix Center for Clinical Trials (Calabasas Hills, CA) using the Roche Glucose/HK Reagent Set (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Results Study subjects A total of 123 subjects were enrolled and randomized, of which 99 (80.5%) completed all dosing days and 24 (19.5%) withdrew prior to receiving the last scheduleddose. Baseline demographics were comparable across treatment arms (Table 2). In the exenatide-naive arm, 77.0% of the subjects completed the study comparedwith 83.9% in the exenatide-primed arm. Of the subjects who withdrew from the study, 8 in the exenatide-naive arm and 3 in the exenatide-primed arm did so becauseof a protocol violation, withdrawal of consent, or an
