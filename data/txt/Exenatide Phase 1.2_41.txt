likely that gastric emptying is a major contributor to glucosecontrol early in the postprandial period but less so in the latepostprandial period. Delivery of nutrients from the stomachto the small intestine is a critical contributor to postprandialglucose excursions (44). Indeed, patients who have under-gone gastrectomy exhibit postprandial hyperglycemia inspite of apparently normal /H9252-cell function and fasting euglycemia (45). Whether gastric emptying rates are slow,normal, or accelerated in patients with diabetes without se-vere autonomic neuropathy is controversial (17). One of themain confounders in understanding the pathophysiology of
