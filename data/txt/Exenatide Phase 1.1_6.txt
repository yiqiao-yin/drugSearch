circulates after the animal bites itsprey and may have endocrine func-tions related to digestion and energyassimilation. 8 Exendin-4 has a 53% amino acid sequence overlap withmammalian glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) but is the product of a sepa-rate gene, distinct from the progluca-gon gene from which lizard GLP-1 isexpressed in the Gila monster. 9 An- tidiabetic actions of e xenatide that are shared with GLP-1 include glucose-dependent enhan cement of insulin secretion, glucose-dependent sup-pression of inappropriately high glu-cagon secretion, slowing of gastricemptying (which may be paradoxi-cally accelerated in humans with dia-betes), reduction of food intake, andpromotion of  Î²-cell proliferation and neogenesis.10-19 Some of these an- tidiabetic actions (e.g., enhancementof insulin secretion) may be mediatedby exenatide binding to the pancreat-ic GLP-1 receptor. 20 These antidia-
