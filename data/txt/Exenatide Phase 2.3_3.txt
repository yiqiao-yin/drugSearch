acid peptide incretin mimetic that exhib-its glucoregulatory activities similar tothose observed with the mammalian in-cretin hormone glucagon-like peptide(GLP)-1 (7–12). The present study wasundertaken to evaluate the ability of ex-enatide to improve glycemic control overa 30-week period in patients with type 2diabetes failing maximally effective dosesof a sulfonylurea. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Subjects were 22–76 years of age and had type 2 diabetestreated with at least the maximally effec-tive dose of a sulfonylurea as mono-therapy (deﬁned below) for at least 3months before screening. General inclu-sion criteria were a screening fastingplasma glucose concentration /H11021240 mg/ dl, BMI 27–45 kg/m 2, and HbA1c7.1– 11.0%, inclusive. In addition, subjectshad stable weight ( /H1100610%) for 3 months before screening and had no clinically rel-evant (for a type 2 diabetic population)abnormal laboratory test values ( /H1102225%
