Plasma glucose Statistically signiﬁcant reductions ( P/H11349 0.004) from baseline to day 28 in meanpostprandial plasma glucose concentra-tion were observed with AC2993 treat-ment [4.4, 3.2, and 3.4 mmol/l for BID(bd), BID (bs), and TID, respectively]compared with placebo (0.6 mmol/l).These results were similar to the reduc-tions seen on the ﬁrst day of treatment(Fig. 2). Mean reductions in fastingplasma glucose after AC2993 treatment atday 28 (range of means 1.2–1.7 mmol/l)were not signiﬁcantly different from pla-cebo (1.1 mmol/l), although there was atrend toward reduced fasting glucosethroughout the study. Compared withday 1, the AC2993 plasma glucose proﬁleon day 28 showed reduced fasting glucoseconcentrations. On day 28, there was amodest rise in postprandial glycemia afterAC2993 treatment; however, this change was markedly lower than in the placebotreatment arm on day 28. Body weight
