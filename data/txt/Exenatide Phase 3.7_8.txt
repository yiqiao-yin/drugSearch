teria were HbA1c of 7.5% to 12.0% (59-108 mmol/mol) and fastingplasma glucose (FPG) <15.6 mmol/L (<280 mg/dL) at screening, andHbA1c of 7.0% to 10.5% (53-91 mmol/mol) at randomization. Completeinclusion and exclusion criteria are provided online in Table S1 inFile S1.The study included a screening visit, an 8-week IG titration phase, a 28-week double-blind treatment phase, and a 10-weeksafety follow-up period (Figure S1 in File S1). Patients continued priormetformin use throughout the study, while sulphonylureas were dis-continued at the start of IG titration, if applicable. During both the IG titration and treatment periods, IG was titrated according to the Initiate Insulin by Aggressive Titration and Education (INITIATE) algorithm (FPG <4.0 mmol/L [<72 mg/dL], insu-lin dose change −2 units; FPG 4.0 to 5.5 mmol/L [72 –99 mg/dL],
