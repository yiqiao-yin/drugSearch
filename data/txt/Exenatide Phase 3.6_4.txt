fairly new class of antihyperglycaemic drugs for patients with type 2 diabetes. 1 These drugs have broad glucoregu- latory actions, including stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, reducing glucagon secretion, de creasing food intake, and slowing gastric emptying. 2 In previous  studies, twice-daily injections of exenatide—the ﬁ  rst  GLP-1 receptor agonist approved—lowered fasting and post prandial glucose concentrations, improved glycaemic control, and decreased bodyweight. 3–6 Furthermore, long- acting GLP-1 receptor agonism has been achieved with fatty acylation (liraglutide) or extended-release formu-lations (exenatide), thereby prolonging the presence of these molecules in the circulation and resulting in formulations that are suitable for daily and weekly adminis tration, respectively. Exenatide, a synthetic form of exendin-4 that stimulates
