urea use at study initiation, if required,subjects had their sulfonylurea dose ad-justed before the placebo lead-in periodto the maximally effective dose (4 mg/dayglimepiride, 20 mg/day glipizide, 10 mg/day glipizide XL, 10 mg/day glyburide, 6mg/day micronized glyburide, 350 mg/day chlorpropamide, or 500 mg/day to-lazamide) (15â€“17). To address the risk ofhypoglycemia, the protocol recom-mended progressive 50% reductions insulfonylurea dose, eventual discontinua-tion (depending on the recurrence of hy-poglycemia) in the event of a documentedepisode of hypoglycemia (glucose /H1102160 mg/dl), or two undocumented but sus-pected episodes of hypoglycemia. Any subject with either an HbA 1c change of 1.5% from baseline at any clinicvisit before study termination or an HbA 1c /H1135011.5% at week 18 or 24 could be with- drawn from the study (loss of glucosecontrol). Similarly, subjects could bewithdrawn if they had fasting plasma glu-cose values /H11022240 mg/dl on two consecu-
