term controlled trial data at 28 days for patientspreviously treated with metformin monother-apy, the reductions in HbA 1c(–0.4%), FPG (–16.2 mg/dL), and body weight (–0.5 kg)47 were remarkably similar. Therefore, the datareported herein are representative of thebroader experience of exenatide use in clinicaltrials to date. In conclusion, exenatide dose-dependently improved glycemic control and reduced bodyweight over 28 days in patients with type 2 di-abetes. These data support the use of the 5 and10 /H9262g b.i.d. regimen in the long-term clinical trials, in that the most common side effects ofexenatide are reduced at lower doses, but theclinical effects of exenatide are improved at 10/H9262g b.i.d. dosing. In addition, these data sup- port the conclusion that the glucose-loweringeffects of exenatide are similar in patients thathad not received prior oral pharmacotherapyand those previously treated with OADs.
