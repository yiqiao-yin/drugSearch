clinically relevant population of evaluablesubjects was used (see below). For ITTsubjects who had recorded values for atleast one scheduled visit subsequent tothe baseline measurement, missing data(including missing values at intermediatevisits) were imputed from scheduled vis-its using the last observation carried for-ward method. The least square means andSEs were derived from the general linearmodel for each treatment. Pairwise com- parisons of the treatment effects were per-formed using Fisherâ€™s protected testingprocedure to control type I errors due tomultiple comparisons (20). Similar anal-yses were performed for body weight,each fasting metabolic parameter, andpostprandial plasma glucose concentra-tions without adjusting for the multiplecomparison.
