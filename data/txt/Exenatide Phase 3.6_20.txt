summarised with frequencies, percentages, and total number of episodes. No intergroup statistical analysis was done in the prespeciﬁ  ed statistical analysis plan. Incidence of onset for adverse events of nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting were summarised in 2-week intervals. An event that spanned more than one 2-week interval was summar-ised only in the interval corres ponding with event onset; thus, no events were counted more than once. Within each 2-week interval, we cal culated the proportion of patients who had the adverse event from the total number of patients remaining in the trial at each deﬁ  ned period.
