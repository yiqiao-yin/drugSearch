The inten-sity of hypoglycemic episodes wasclassified as mild to moderate or se-vere. Mild to moderate hypoglyce-mia was defined as patient-reportedsymptoms consistent with hypogly-cemia that may have been associatedwith a documented plasma glucoseconcentration value of <60 mg/dL.For severe hypoglycemia, patientswere to have required the assistanceof another person to obtain treat-ment for their hypoglycemia, includ-ing i.v. glucose or i.m. glucagon.Quantification of plasma glucose, in-sulin, and glucagon was p erformed by Esoterix Laboratories (Calaba-sas Hills, CA) or Quest Diagnostics(San Juan Capistrano, CA) using
