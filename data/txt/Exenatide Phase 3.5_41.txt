(sitagliptin or saxagliptin) were also cited as potential sec-ondary agents in the 2009 AACE/ACE algorithm for dual ortriple therapy, given their low risk of hypoglycemia, safety,and efficacy (5). However, sitaglipin has been shown to havea smaller impact on postprandial glucose excursions com-pared with ExBID (31), and ExQW (23) demonstrated su-perior reduction in HbA1c and significantly greater weightloss over 26 wk compared with sitagliptin. Additional GLP-1 receptor agonists approved or in de- velopment for the treatment of type 2 diabetes includeliraglutide and taspoglutide, respectively. The 1.8-mgdose of liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog with two amino acidsubstitutions (32) that is administered once daily, has beenreported to improve HbA1c by /H110021.0% to /H110021.5% over 26- or 52-wk treatment periods (33–37). Once-weekly admin-istration of 5–20 mg taspoglutide over 8 wk has been re-ported to improve HbA1c by /H110021.0% to /H110021.2% over 8 wk
