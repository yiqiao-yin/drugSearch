creased in weekly increments up to targetdoses of 2,000 and 45 mg/day, respec- tively. MET could be increased up to 2,500 mg/day based on glycemic control.Standard diet and exercise counseling wasprovided in each treatment group. Fol- lowing 26 weeks, patients stopped study treatment and were allowed to followdiabetes regimens deemed appropriate by the investigator, with the exception of exenatide BID. Patients returned to thestudy sites 10 weeks after study end for collection of additional safety data. Statistical analysis Data were reported for randomized pa- tients who received at least one dose of thestudy drug (intent-to-treat population).To control family-wise error within 0.05, the Bonferroni-Hommel gate-keeping procedure was used to test hypotheses.Three noninferiority hypotheses (EQW is inferior to MET, PIO, and SITA) were tested ﬁrst using the Bonferroni test (non- inferiority margin 0.3%, Bonferroni- adjusted signi ﬁcance of 0.0167).
