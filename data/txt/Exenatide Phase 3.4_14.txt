SITA, respectively. The original primary analysis, which excluded post-baseline ob- servations from patients who discontinued before week 8, showed LS mean (SE) reduc-tions in HbA 1cof21.56% (0.07%) with EQW;21.52% (0.06%) with MET ( P= 0.609 vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 20.26 to 0.17);21.73% (0.08%) with PIO ( P= 0.107 vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 20.08 to 0.41); and 21.17% (0.08%) with SITA (P,0.001 vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 20.63 to 20.16). Findings from original and modi ﬁed primary analyses were consis- tent and demonstrated that EQW was non-inferior to MET and SITA, but did not reach the noninferiority measure with PIO. Sub- sequent hypothesis testing concluded thatEQW was superior to SITA, but not to MET. Similar percentages of EQW-, MET-, and PIO-treated patients reached a target HbA 1c,7.0% (Fig. 2 B). Signi ﬁcantly more patients treated with EQW versus SITA ( P,0.001) achieved HbA 1c ,7.0% after 26 weeks. Moreover, signif- icantly more patients treated with EQW
