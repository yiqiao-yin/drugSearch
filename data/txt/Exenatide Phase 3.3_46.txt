control, suggesting a delay or poor application of the insulin titration algorithm. The 3-year study results suggest that some of the  ﬁ ndings associated with exenatide that were potentially  concerning at 26 weeks, 4 such as gastrointestinal adverse  events (consistent with a previous analysis25), injection- site reactions, increased heart rate, and anti-exenatide antibody formation, decrease with time. Although withdrawal because of adverse events in the exenatide group was more common than in the glargine group, it was less frequent during the extension period than during the core study period. The data for anti-exenatide antibodies allow the best  assessment of long-term eﬀ  ects of exenatide so far. The proportion of patients testing positive for anti-exenatide antibodies decreased with time, and few patients had high antibody titres. The ﬁ  nding that  patients with high titres have a decreased glycaemic beneﬁ  t is consistent with a previous ﬁ  nding that such
