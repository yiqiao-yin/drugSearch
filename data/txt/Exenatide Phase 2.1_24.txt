groups, indicating a dose-dependent response.The incidence of nausea was greatest duringthe first week of treatment (33% of exenatide-treated subjects and 6% of placebo-treated sub-jects). In contrast, 6% of exenatide-treated sub-jects and 0% of placebo-treated subjectsreported nausea during the final week of treat-ment. Two patients, both in the 2.5 /H9262g b.i.d. ex- enatide group, reported experiencing hypo-glycemia during the trial. Neither patientrequired medical intervention, and each eventwas classified by the study investigators asmild to moderate in nature. DISCUSSION Exenatide is the first in a new class of agents defined as incretin mimetics that are in devel-opment for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 25 In this 28-day randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial, exenatide caused sta-tistically significant dose-dependent reduc-tions in HbA 1c, at doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 /H9262g b.i.d. In addition, exenatide was associated
