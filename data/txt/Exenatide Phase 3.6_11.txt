Liraglutide was uptitrated from 0·6 mg per day, to 1·2 mg per day, then to 1·8 mg per day. Each titration was to be completed after at least 1 week, but could be delayed if the patient had severe nausea or vomiting as established by the investigator. Patients not tolerating the 1·8 mg liraglutide dose by week 4 were withdrawn from the study. Laboratory testing was done at a central laboratory (Quintiles, West Lothian, UK) with standard methods. We measured concentrations of total amylase, pancreatic lipase, and calcitonin throughout the study.  The study included a 10 week extension period after  discontinuation of study drug administration to follow-up any potential safety signals of either drug. This follow-up visit occurred either 10 weeks after visit 11 (week 26) or at early discontinuation. This report is limited to on-treatment, 26-week eﬃ   cacy, and safety data.  Outcomes The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c at week 26
