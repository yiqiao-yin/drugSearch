was three times higher in patients given glargine (0·9 events per patient per year) than in those given exenatide (0·3 events per patient per year), independent of HbA 1c at week 156. No major hypoglycaemic events  resulting in loss of consciousness or seizures were reported during the study. Risk of minor hypoglycaemia (daytime, night-time, and overall) was increased in patients receiving background sulfonylureas in both groups (ﬁ  gure 4A). The exposure-adjusted rate of minor  hypoglycaemia was generally lower in patients treated with exenatide than in those given glargine, irrespective of background sulfonylurea treatment or whether HbA 1c  control was achieved (ﬁ  gure 4). Exposure-adjusted event rates of minor hypoglycaemia were consistently higher in patients who achieved HbA 1c control than in those who  did not (ﬁ  gure 4B). The proportion of patients in the exenatide group who
