cantly reduced from baseline values at each time point  during the day (before and after each meal) with ex-  enatide 5 pg (all, P .< 0.004) and 10 pg (all, P .< 0.030)  and placebo after the midday (P = 0.033) and evening  (P = 0.040) meals (Figure 4). Compared with placebo,  reductions in 6-point SMBG profiles were signifi-  cantly greater at all time points during the day with  exenatide 5 pg (all, P .< 0.028) and 10 pg (all, P .<  0.015) except for evening premeal with exenatide  10 pg (Figure 4). Reductions in daily mean SMBG  from baseline to end point were significantly greater  with exenatide 5 pg (-27.2 [3.8] mg/dL; P < 0.001)  and exenatide 10 pg (-26.8 [3.8] mg/dL; P < 0.001)  than with placebo (-4.9 [3.6] mg/dL).  Postprandial glucose excursions were significantly  reduced from baseline to end point in the morning, at  midday, and in the evening in the exenatide 5- and  10-pg groups (all, P < 0.001) and with placebo at mid-  14S2 Volume 30 Number 8
