compared with placebo (Fig. 3). On d 5, mean plasma insulin concentrations in the placebo group increased from 8.4 /H110061.3 /H9262U/ml (58.3 /H110069.0 pmol/liter) at baseline to 86.3 /H1100628.0 /H9262U/ml (599.4 /H11006194.5 pmol/liter) at 120 min and then de- creased to 15.8 /H110063.1/H9262U/ml (109.7 /H1100622.2 pmol/liter) at 300 min. In contrast, mean plasma insulin concentrations in-creased from 9.1 /H110061.5 /H9262U/ml (63.9 /H1100610.4 pmol/liter) at baseline to 38.4 /H110069.8/H9262U/ml (266.7 /H1100668.1 pmol/liter) at 90 min during treatment with 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993 and decreased only slightly at 180 min, 240 min, and 300 min to 25.4 /H110066.6 /H9262U/ml (176.4 /H1100647.2 pmol/liter), 31.1 /H110066.3/H9262U/ml (216.0 /H11006 43.8 pmol/liter), and 33.8 /H110065.9/H9262U/ml (234.7 /H1100641.0 pmol/ liter), respectively. On d 5, the insulin AUC(0â€“300min) wasreduced 35% following 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993 treatment, com-
