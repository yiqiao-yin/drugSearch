was low in all treatment groups: 5.2% (13/248), 4.1% (10/246), 3.7% (6/163), and 3.1% (5/163) of EQW-, MET-, PIO-,and SITA-treated patients, respectively. Minor (con ﬁrmed) hypoglycemia was lim- ited to a small group of EQW-treated pa-tients (5/248, 2.0%). No clinically signi ﬁcant changes in fasting serum lipids were observed during the treatment period. LS mean (SE) sys-tolic blood pressure reductions of 21.3 mmHg (0.8 mmHg), 21.7 mmHg (1.0 mmHg), and 21.8 mmHg (1.0 mmHg) were observed with EQW, PIO, and SITA treatment, respectively. Additionally, a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of22.5 mmHg (0.6 mmHg) was observed with PIO treatment. Mean (SD) heart rate (bpm) increases were observed in the EQW[+1.5 (10.0)], MET [+0.3 (9.5)], and SITA[+0.5 (9.7)] groups; mean heart rate de- creased in the PIO group [ –1.7 (8.7)].
