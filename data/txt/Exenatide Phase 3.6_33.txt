sig niﬁ  cantly better glycaemic control, as measured by  HbA1c, in patients treated with oral anti hyperglycaemic  drugs. In drug-naive patients, exenatide once weekly improved HbA 1c better than did sitagliptin and was non- inferior to metformin, but did not achieve non-inferiority to pioglitazone. 24 Treatment with the maximum dose of  liraglutide (1·8 mg) resulted in better glycaemic control than with exenatide twice daily, 17 sitagliptin,25 insulin  glargine,14 and submaximum doses of gli mepiride18 and  rosiglitazone.16 Thus, the clinically meaningful reduc- tions in HbA1c noted for these longacting GLP-1 receptor 0 0–2 2–4 4–6 6–8 8–10 10–12 12–14 14–16 Time (weeks)16–18 18–20 20–22 22–24 24–26 >265Patients with nausea (%)1015 Exenatide once weekly (n=461) Liraglutide once daily (n=450) 05Patients with diarrhoea (%)1015 05Patients with vomiting (%)1015 Figure 4: Patients with nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting over time
