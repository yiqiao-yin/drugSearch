416 M. S. Fineman et al. as antihypertensives (alpha blockers) and psychotropics (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). In addition,anecdotal evidence in the medical literature supports the use of gradual dose-escalation to mitigate side effects. For example, Ohira et al. [17] reported a patient with dose-limiting reactions to the protein erythropoietin whoresponded to dose-escalation with complete amelioration of adverse side effects. While clinical practice experience is important in suggesting how best to dose a givendrug safely, it is also important to better understandthe therapeutic feasibility and magnitude of effect ofdose-escalation. Clearly, esta blishing that dose-escalation reduces dose-limiting adverse events can serve to design better treatment algorithms t hat minimize adverse events and maximize therapeutic dose. The proportion of subjects experiencing dose-limiting nausea and vomiting caused by acute administration
