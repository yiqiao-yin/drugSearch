Treatment-emergent adverse events in other sys- tem/organ classes that occurred in more than 5% ofsubjects were headache in 14 subjects (11.4%; 7 sub- jects each arm), decreased appetite in 10 subjects (8.1%; 5 subjects each arm), dizziness (excluding vertigo) in 9subjects (7.3%; 4 in exenatide-naive arm), and mild-to-moderate injection-site bruising in 9 subjects (7.3%; 6 in exenatide-naive arm). Only one incident of headache was rated severe (exenatide-naive arm); the remainder wererated mild or moderate in intensity. Fasting serum glucose proﬁle Fasting serum glucose concentrations progressively decreased in the exenatide-primed arm during the ﬁrst 35-day dosing phase in parallel with exenatide doseincrements of 0 .02µg/kg TID every 3 days (Figure 3). All fasting serum glucose concentrations after the initia- tion of dosing were signiﬁcantly lower than at baseline(p≤0.001). By the end of the 35-day dosing phase, fast- ing serum glucose in the exenatide-primed arm was 34%
