based on the known pharmacology of GLP-1. For example, GLP-1 but not exendin-4 has been shown to suppress gastricacid secretion (23), and intraportal GLP-1 infusion triggersthe hepatic vagal afferents but exendin-4 does not (24). Thereasons for these apparent differences are yet unknown.Also, in animal (25 â€“27) and in vitro (26, 27) models, AC2993 has been shown to promote /H9252-cell proliferation and neogen- esis from precursor cells, thus transforming noninsulin-producing cells into insulin-producing cells. Other data ob-tained in animal models of insulin resistance suggest thatAC2993 may also have an insulin sensitizing effect (22), al-though this has not yet been shown in humans (28). The current studies were designed to examine the post-
