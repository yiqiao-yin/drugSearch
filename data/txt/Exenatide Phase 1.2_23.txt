pared with placebo ( P/H110050.0011). Results were similar on d 1a n dd5 . Postprandial plasma glucagon. No change from baseline was noted in mean postprandial plasma glucagon concentrationsduring the 180 min following 0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993 treatment, whereas mean concentrations increased significantly follow-ing placebo treatment (Fig. 4A). During treatment with pla-cebo on d 5, mean plasma glucagon concentrations increasedfrom 94.9 /H110068.9 pg/ml (94.9 /H110068.9 ng/liter) at baseline to 173.9/H1100622.5 pg/ml (173.9 /H1100622.5 ng/liter) at 60 min and then decreased slowly to 122.7 /H1100618.1 pg/ml (122.7 /H1100618.1 ng/ liter) at 180 min. In contrast, mean plasma glucagon con-centrations were comparatively unchanged throughout the180-min postprandial sampling period after treatment with0.1 /H9262g/kg AC2993 relative to the mean baseline concentra- tion (98.9 /H110067.2 pg/ml; 98.9 /H110067.2 ng/liter).
