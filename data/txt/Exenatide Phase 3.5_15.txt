Hypotheses for demonstration of both su-periority and noninferiority were prespeci-fied in the protocol. Noninferiority ofExQW to ExBID was demonstrated if theupper limit of the two-sided 95% confi-dence interval (CI) for the difference be-tween treatments fell beneath 0.4%; supe-riority was demonstrated if the CI wasbelow zero (21). Other tests were conductedtwo sided at a significance level of 0.05.Multiplicity from tests of treatment differ-ences for the proportion of patients achiev-ing the targets of HbA1c less than 7.0% andFPG 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/liter) or less at wk24, and the change in FPG from baseline towk 24 were adjusted using the Hochbergprocedure (22) to control the overall type Ierror rate at a 5% level. The changes in HbA1c and FPG be- tween treatments were compared usinggeneral linear models, including factorsfor treatment group, baseline HbA1c stra- tum, and concomitant SU use at screening.
