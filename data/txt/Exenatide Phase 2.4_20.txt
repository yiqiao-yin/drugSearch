dose (dosage factor). (B) Graph for proportion of subjectsexperiencing nausea and vomiting, corrected for dosage factor subjects experiencing nausea was higher in the exenatide- naive arm (62.3%) than in the exenatide-primed arm (46.8%). Kaplan–Meier analysis up to Day 43 yielded signiﬁcantly different values of 0.73 for the exenatide- naive arm and 0.48 for the exenatide-primed arm (p=0.0047). Summary of adverse events No serious adverse events were observed. A total of 108 subjects experienced 508 treatment-emergent adverse events, distributed similarly across treatment arms. Fifty- seven subjects (93.4%) in the exenatide-naive arm experienced 231 adverse eve nts and 51 subjects (82.3%) in the exenatide-primed arm experienced 277 adverse events. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders, with 88 subjects (71.5%) experiencing 318 events, primarily nausea or Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
