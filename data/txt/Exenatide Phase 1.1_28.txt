the placebo group (37.5%). The mostcommon treatment-emergent eventsin the exenatide groups were mild tomoderate nausea and vomiting,which occurred in the 0.02- and 0.1- µg/kg exenatide groups but not the 0.05-µg/kg group. In the 0.02- µg/kg group, 1 patient (12.5%) had nauseaand 1 (12.5%) experienced vomiting.In the 0.1- µg/kg group, 3 patients (37.5%) developed nausea and 1(12.5%) experienced vomiting. Twopatients (25%) in the placebo groupdeveloped diarrhea. One patient(12.5%) in the placebo group and 2(25.0%) in the 0.05- µg/kg exenatide group experienced headache. Onecase of mild hypoglycemia (12.5%)occurred in the 0.1- µg/kg exenatide group. Discussion Administration of a single s.c. injection of exenatide resulted indose-proportional circulating con-centrations of exenatide. Exenatidewas detectable in plasma as early as10–15 minutes postdose (the earliestFigure 2.  Glucose pharmacodynamics. (A) Mean ± S.E. (bars) plasma glucose concentrations
