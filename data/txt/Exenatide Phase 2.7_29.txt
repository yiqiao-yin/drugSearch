from baseline to end point by -0.8 (0.7) mm Hg in the  exenatide 5-pg group (P = NS) and -2.3 (0.7) mm Hg  in the exenatide 10-pg group (P = 0.046) compared  with -0.3 (0.7) mm Hg with placebo.  Changes in fasting TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C from  baseline to end point were not significantly different with  exenatide 5- and 10-p,g treatment versus placebo (TC,  -0.2 [1.6] and -1.1 [1.6] vs +3.4 [1.6] mg/dL; HDL-C,  +1.3 [0.4] and +0.4 [0.4] vs +0.5 [0.4] mg/dL; and  LDL-C,-2.0 [1.3] and-1.3 [1.4] vs +1.4 [1.3] mg/dL). Adverse Events and Hypoglycemia  No deaths occurred during the study. Overall, 25%  (57/232) of patients reported >1 treatment-emergent  adverse event (exenatide 5 pg, 21% [16/77]; exenatide  10 pg, 33% [26/78]; and placebo, 19% [15/77]). In  88% (50/57) of the patients who reported >1 treatment-  emergent adverse event, the event(s) were mild or  moderate in intensity. Two patients, both in the exena-  tide 10-pg group, discontinued due to a treatment-
