concentration profiles were consistent with glucose-depen-dent insulinotropism. AC2993 was well tolerated. Mild tran-sient headache, nausea, and vomiting were the main adverseevents. In conclusion, AC2993 acutely and markedly reducesfasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in patientswith type 2 diabetes. During fasting, glucose-dependent en-hancement of insulin secretion and suppression of glucagonsecretion are the predominant mechanisms, and postprandi-ally, slowing of gastric emptying is additionally operative.This robust antidiabetic effect warrants further evaluation ofAC2993. ( J Clin Endocrinol Metab 88: 3082â€“3089, 2003) THE PATHOGENESIS OF type 2 diabetes is generally characterized by two principal abnormalities: periph- eral insulin resistance, which alone rarely results in clinicaldiabetes, and progressive failure of pancreatic /H9252-cell function
