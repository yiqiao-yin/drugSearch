The reduction in number of drug-induced side effects withincreasing duration of drug exposure, a phenomenonknown as tolerance, is well documented in medicalliterature [9]. In addition, t he induction of drug tolerance does not appear to be limited to any particular chemicalclass of therapeutic compounds or disease targets [9].TheÎ±-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, and the biguanide metformin are two examples of antidiabetic agents witha recommended schedule of stepwise dose-escalation atthe initiation of treatment for the purpose of buildingtolerance to dose-limiting gastrointestinal side effects[11â€“14]. In both cases, the recommendation to slowlyescalate the doses came from post hoc analyses of clinical trial data or from clinical experience. For example, in a retrospective analysis of 677 elderly subjects ( >65 years old) with diabetes, subjects who initiated acarbosetreatment at a higher daily dose ( >100 mg) were 1.4-
