portant limitation that may have influenced patient ex-pectations or behaviors. Patient withdrawal rates werehigher among ExBID patients compared with ExQW pa-tients; however, the identical HbA1c reductions observedin both the ITT and the evaluable populations suggest thatthis difference in withdrawal rates did not impact study outcomes. Continuous GLP-1 receptor agonism withExQW resulted in superior glycemic control, with lessnausea, compared with ExBID in patients with type 2 di-abetes. Similar weight loss was observed in both groups,with no difference in the risk of hypoglycemia. Acknowledgments The authors thank the exenatide DURATION-5 clinical team for
