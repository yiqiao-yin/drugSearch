gastric emptying in diabetes is hyperglycemia itself becauseelevated glucose concentrations in nondiabetics slow gastricemptying rate (46). Thus, a normal gastric emptying rate inthe face of hyperglycemia may be considered pathophysio-logic because it is relatively accelerated, compared with anexpected normal slowing in the face of hyperglycemia. Gastric emptying as assessed by acetaminophen appear- ance rates in plasma after oral administration was slowed byAC2993 (Table 2). Meal-entrained endogenous enteropan-creatic hormones such as cholecystokinin, amylin, and GLP-1also slow gastric emptying, attesting to the importance of thisfunction for overall nutrient assimilation (47). AC2993 exhibited sustained activity with respect to post-
