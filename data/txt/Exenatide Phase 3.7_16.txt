ments included routine chemistry and haematology measures,urinalysis, serum calcitonin, serum creatinine, calculated creatinineclearance (Cockcroft-Gault formula) and anti-exenatide antibodies.Predefined cardiovascular AEs were adjudicated by an adjudicationcommittee of independent cardiologists blinded to study treatment (Table S5 in File S1). For all study endpoints, change from baseline was calculated from the last non-missing assessment before the firstdose of study drug at randomization.2.5 |Statistical analyses Primary and secondary efficacy variables were analysed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized patientswho received ≥1 dose of study drug with ≥1 post-baseline HbA1c assessment. The primary endpoint was assessed using a mixed- effects model for repeated measures (MMRM), with change in HbA1c as the dependent variable; treatment, region, baseline HbA1c stratum (<9.0% or ≥9.0% [<75 or ≥75 mmol/mol]), baseline sulphonylurea-use
