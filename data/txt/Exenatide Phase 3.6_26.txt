Change in HbA1c at endpoint was greater in patients  taking liraglutide than in those taking exenatide (p=0·02),  and the upper bound of the 95% CI did not meet non-inferiority criteria (table 2). 271 (60%) patients receiving liraglutide and 243 (53%) receiving exenatide achieved HbA 1c of less than 7% (53 mmol/mol; p=0·0011). Both treatments were associated with progressive  decreases in bodyweight (ﬁ  gure 3). Patients taking liraglutide lost more weight than did those taking exenatide, irrespective of body-mass index (table 2). At 26 weeks, fasting serum glucose signiﬁ  cantly decreased
