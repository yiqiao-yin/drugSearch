Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disorder character- ized by defects in the secretion and action of multiple glucoregulatory hormones, resulting in hyperglycemia.Achieving glycemic control and reduction of glycosylatedhemoglobin (HbA1c) has been shown to reduce the risk oflong-term microvascular and possibly macrovascular com-plications of diabetes (1). However, optimal treatment ofdiabetes must address both glycemic control and such co-morbidities as obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (2, 3).Although several therapies are currently approved for thetreatment of type 2 diabetes, there remains a need for treat-ments with demonstrated effects on both hyperglycemia andassociated comorbidities, with minimal risk of hypoglycemiaand weight gain.
