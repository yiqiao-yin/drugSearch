to-insulin ratio in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm indicated that exenatide had a bene-ﬁcial effect on the /H9252-cell (32). In a parallel, 30-week placebo-controlled phase IIIstudy in subjects with type 2 diabetes fail-ing to achieve glycemic control with met-formin and a sulfonylurea, the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm had signiﬁcant placebo-adjusted reductions of /H110021.0% in HbA 1c and/H110020.7 kg in weight at week 30 (36). Thus, exenatide appears to elicit similarglycemic effects whether patients are onbackground metformin or sulfonylurea ora combination of both. Combining exenatide with met- formin did not increase the risk of hypo-glycemia. It is acknowledged thatmetformin is antihyperglycemic in its ac-tion and has little or no hypoglycemic po-tential. That noted, although there was abackground incidence of hypoglycemiain the metformin-plus-placebo group, itwas mild or moderate in nature and ofquestionable clinical signiﬁcance. Impor-tantly, despite a decrease of nearly 1% inHbA
