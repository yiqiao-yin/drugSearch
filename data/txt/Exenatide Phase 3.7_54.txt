investigated the efficacy and safety of combining a QW GLP-1RA with titrated basal IG22,23; however, caution is needed when making between-study comparisons because of the differences in study designs and populations. Consistent with the DURATION-7 study, adding a QW GLP-1RA to basal insulin resulted in significantimprovements in glycaemic control and weight loss in both studies. The HARMONY-6 study comprised a 4- to 8-week IG dose stan- dardization/titration period, followed by a 52-week treatment period. 22Despite recommendations of IG titration algorithms from both the HARMONY-6 and DURATION-7 studies, these were not consistently implemented in practice, as the mean IG dose increased only modestly after randomization in both groups (by 6-7 units at26 weeks in HARMONY-6 22and 2-4 units in DURATION-7). The AWARD-923study compared the addition of QW dulaglu- tide 1.5 mg or placebo to IG in patients with HbA1c of 7.0 to 10.5%(53-91 mmol/mol).
