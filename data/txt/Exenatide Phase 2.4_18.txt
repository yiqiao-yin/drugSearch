pattern was likely attributable to preconditioning during the informed consent process where it was explained thatsubjects could expect to experience nausea and vomiting during the study. Subject dropout rates due to nausea or vomiting were estimated on the basis of the raw proportion of subjects who withdrew owing to nausea and/or vomiting by the date of the last dose. Prior to receiving the 0.24µg/kg dose, 3 subjects (4.9%) in the exenatide- naive arm and 7 subjects (11.3%) in the exenatide-primed arm withdrew because of nausea and/or vomiting. Within the exenatide-primed arm, subjects withdrew at the following doses: 0 .02µg/kg (1), 0 .10µg/kg (1), 0.12µg/kg (2), 0 .16µg/kg (1), 0 .2µg/kg (1), 0 .22µg/kg (1). As predicted, more subjects in the exenatide-naive arm reported severe nausea (47.5%) and severe vomiting (31.1%) than subjects in the exenatide-primed arm (29.0% and 9.7%, respectively). The proportion of subjects experiencing all nausea
