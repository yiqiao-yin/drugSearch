events, hypoglycemia, and blood pressure.  Results: A total of 232 patients were included in  the intent-to-treat population (130 men, 102 women;  68% white; mean [SD] age, 54 [10] years; duration of  type 2 diabetes, 2 [3] years; weight, 86 [16] kg; body  mass index, 31 [5] kg/m-~; HbAI~, 7.8% [0.9%]). At  end point, least-squares mean (SE) HbAI~ reductions (%) from baseline were significantly greater with ex-  enatide 5 and 10 pg than placebo (-0.7 [0.1] and -0.9  [0.1] vs -0.2 [0.1]; P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respec-  tively), as were FSG reductions (mg/dL) (-17.5 [4.0]  and-18.7 [4.0] vs -5.2 [4.0]; P = 0.029 and P =  0.016, respectively). Changes in daily mean postpran-  dial glucose excursions (mg/dL) from baseline to end  point were significantly greater with exenatide 5 and  10 pg than placebo (-21.3 [2.7] and -24.7 [2.7] vs  -8.3 [2.5]; both, P < 0.001). With exenatide 5 and  10 pg, 31% and 35% of patients achieved HbAlc  <6.5% at end point versus 19% with placebo (P = NS
