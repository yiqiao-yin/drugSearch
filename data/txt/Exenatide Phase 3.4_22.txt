No clinically signi ﬁcant changes in mean amylase, lipase, or calcitonin wereobserved during the treatment period. One SITA-treated patient with elevated lipase at screening experienced moderate chronicpancreatitis after 8 days of treatment anddiscontinued from study treatment. Lower-titer ( ,1/125) and higher-titer ($1/625) antibodies to exenatide at end point were observed in 43.1% (107/248) and 11.3% (28/248) of EQW-treated patients, respectively. Mean HbA 1cwas reduced irrespective of antibody status: negative ( 21.33%), positive lower (21.51%), and positive higher ( 21.02%) (Supplementary Table 3). Events withhigher incidence in antibody-positive pa- tients included injection site –related events (i.e., injection site erythema, injec-tion site extravasation, injection site hema- toma, injection site nodule, injection site pruritus, and injection site reaction). In-jection site nodules are expected with mi- crosphere injection and were not reported
