This was a two-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled,triple-blind (subjects, investigators, and sponsor), mul-ticenter study. The study was designed to compare theproportion of subjects experiencing nausea and vomitingafter receiving a target dose of exenatide that was knownto cause nausea and vomiting (0 .24µg/kg), delivered either in a dose-escalation regimen (exenatide-primedarm) or as a ﬁrst-time exposure (exenatide-naive arm;Table 1). In the exenatide-primed arm, subjects receivedprogressively increasing doses of exenatide 3 times aday (TID), starting from 0 .02µg/kg TID and increasing by 0.02µg/kg increments per dose every 3 days until reaching a maximum dose of 0 .24µg/kg TID on approx- imately Day 35 ±1d a y( 1 1t o t a ld o s el e v e l s ) .T h eﬁ n a l dose of 0 .24µg/kg TID was continued for 3 days. The exenatide-naive arm received equivalent escalating vol-umes of placebo TID for approximately 35 days ( ±1
