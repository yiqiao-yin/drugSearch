treatment, mean fasting plasma glucagon concentrations ap-peared to be markedly suppressed, compared with placebo(Fig. 4B); however, because of small sample size, this effectdid not reach statistical significance. Afte r 3 h post dose and coincident with reaching the glucose concentration nadir,little difference in fasting plasma glucagon concentrationswere observed among the AC2993 treatments and placebo.Inspection of individual subject data did not reveal suppres-sion of fasting plasma glucagon beyon d 3 h post dose by AC2993 treatments. Safety. No clinically meaningful differences were noted in the physical examination findings, electrocardiograms, vitalsigns, or clinical laboratory measures following treatmentwith 0.05 /H9262g/kg, 0.1 /H9262g/kg, 0.2 /H9262g/kg AC2993 or placebo.
