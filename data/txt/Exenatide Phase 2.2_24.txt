There was no signiﬁcant effect of AC2993treatment on change in body weight fromday 1 to day 28 (range of means /H110020.8 to /H110010.1 kg) compared with placebo treat- ment arm ( /H110010.9 kg). There was no detect- able inﬂuence of baseline HbA 1c, baseline body weight, or concomitant antidiabetic therapy on weight loss; however, theoverall size of the cohort and the durationof the trial were insufﬁcient to deﬁnitivelystate that these were not covariates. Lipids There were no notable differences amongthe treatment groups in fasting concentra-tions of triglycerides, HDL cholesterol,LDL cholesterol, or apolipoprotein B at day 28. While not statistically signiﬁcant,incremental (baseline-adjusted) time-weighted average postprandial triglycer-ide concentrations tended to be decreasedat day 28 compared with day –1 in theAC2993 treatment groups (change fromday –1 to day 28, range /H110020.25 to –0.35 mmol/l) compared with placebo (changefrom day –1 to day 28, 0.14 mmol/l).
