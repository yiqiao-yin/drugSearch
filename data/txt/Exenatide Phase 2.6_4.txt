acid peptide incretin mimetic that exhib-its glucoregulatory activities similar to themammalian incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (11–22). These ac-tions include glucose-dependentenhancement of insulin secretion, sup-pression of inappropriately high glucagonsecretion, and slowing of gastric empty-ing. Exenatide’s glucose-dependent en-hancement of insulin secretion may bemediated by exenatide binding to thepancreatic GLP-1 receptor (23). In animalmodels of diabetes and in insulin-secreting cell lines, exenatide and GLP-1reportedly improve /H9252-cell function by in- creasing the expression of key genes in-volved in insulin secretion, increasinginsulin biosynthesis, and augmenting/H9252-cell mass through multiple mecha- nisms (17). Data obtained in animal mod-els also indicate that exenatide and GLP-1reduce food intake, cause weight loss, andhave an insulin-sensitizing effect(13,14,17,24,25).
