1cstratum and corresponding baseline value as a covariate. Change in other variables during the open-label phase were analysed based on a general linear model,including factors for treatment, country and correspondingvalues of variables at week 26as a c ovariate. Log-transformation was applied to triglycerides and cardiovascular risk markers before ﬁtting the model. Compar ison of proportions achieving HbA 1cand fasting plasma glucose targets between week 26 and week 52 within each treatment group was performed using aMcNemar test. Mean change from baseline for efﬁcacyendpoints was expressed as least s quare means. Statistical tests were conducted two-sided at a signiﬁcance level of 0.05 usingSAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Results Patient disposition and baseline characteristics Demographics and baseline chara cteristics for the 52-week evaluable population were similar between treatment arms(Fig. 2) and 87–89% of patients completed this 26-week
