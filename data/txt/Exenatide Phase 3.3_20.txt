The least-squares mean reductions in HbA 1c were  numerically greater throughout the study in the exenatide group than in the glargine group in all baseline HbA 1c  categories between 7·1% (54 mmol/mol) and 11·0% (97 mmol/mol; appendix). In the mITT population, 86 (40%) of 216 given exenatide versus 69 (33%) of 212 given glargine achieved HbA 1c concentrations of
