glucose concentrations in the 10- and 5-/H9262g exenatide arms were reduced by /H110020.6/H110060.3 and /H110020.3/H110060.2 mmol/l from baseline, respectively, compared with anincrease of 0.4 /H110060.3 mmol/l in the pla- cebo arm ( P/H110210.05 vs. placebo for the 10-/H9262g arm only). Body weight Body weights averaged /H1101196 kg at baseline (Fig. 1) and were slightly higher in theplacebo arm than in the exenatide arms.Subjects in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm had progressive weight loss over the entire 30weeks, with an end-of-study loss of/H110021.6/H110060.3 kg from baseline ( P/H110210.05 vs. placebo) (Fig. 3). Subjects in the 5- /H9262g exenatide arm had an end-of-studyweight loss of /H110020.9/H110060.3 kg from base- line (NS vs. placebo), and subjects in theplacebo arm had an end-of-study weightloss of/H110020.6/H110060.3 kg from baseline.
