investigators using the recommendations and their clinical judgment. Patients began with 10 IU glargine per day (injected at the same time every day, preferably bedtime), measured fasting blood glucose concentrations every morning, and were instructed to adjust glargine doses to achieve target concentrations of 4·0–5·5 mmol/L. Concomitant oral glucose-lowering therapies were continued at stable doses (unless hypoglycaemia occurred with sulfonylureas; appendix) until at least week 48, after which changes could be made (appendix). During the core treatment period, study visits were at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26. From week 36, patients made follow-up visits at 12-week intervals.Outcomes The primary eﬃ   cacy measure at week 156 was change in HbA 1c from baseline (measured as percentage and  converted to mmol/mol). Secondary measures were the proportion of patients achieving HbA 1c targets (<7·0%
