tiation of QW treatment, the mean FPG inthis group of subjects had returned to lev-els observed before they switched to ex-enatide QW, which was followed byfurther improvements such that ulti-mately the two groups exhibited similarreductions in FPG. Patients concomi-tantly taking an SFU ( n/H1100544) reduced their SFU dose to the minimum recom-mended dose at week 30 according toprotocol and experienced a greater rise inFPG during the transition than patientsnot taking an SFU (data not shown). Atweek 52, 45% ( n/H1100520) of these patients received a lower SFU dose compared withtheir SFU dose immediately beforeswitching to exenatide QW, whereas 43%(n/H1100519) received the same SFU dose and 9% ( n/H110054) increased the SFU dose at week 52 compared with week 30. Onepatient discontinued SFU treatment afterswitching to exenatide QW. Effects on blood pressure and fasting
