blood glucose concentrations less than 3 mmol/L. By protocol, investigators were instructed not to  change metformin and pioglitazone doses during the study. In patients given sulfonylurea, investigators were advised to reduce the dose if the patient had hypoglycaemia. If additional hypoglycaemia occurred, investigators were to consider discontinuing sulfo-nylurea. If necessary, sulfonylureas could be reinsti tuted for glycaemic control, but the dose at week 26 could not exceed that at randomisation. Statistical analysis Primary hypotheses were non-inferiority and superiority of exenatide versus liraglutide for change in HbA 1c. We  concluded non-inferiority of exenatide if the upper limit of the 95% CI was less than 0·25% (3 mmol/mol). In this case we tested superiority, concluding superiority of exenatide if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the treatment diﬀ erence (exenatide minus liraglutide) was less than zero.  We used closed testing to minimise rate of type I error.
