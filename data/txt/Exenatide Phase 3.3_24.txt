Change in (A) HbA1c and (B) fasting serum glucose concentrations with time. (C) Eight-point self-monitored blood glucose proﬁ  les at week 156 for patients with  available data. (D) Changes in bodyweight. For all variables, only patients from the modiﬁ  ed intention-to-treat population  with a baseline value and at least one  post-baseline value for the outcome measure were included in the analysis. Error bars show SEs. Between-treatment comparisons were done for HbA1c, fasting serum  glucose concentrations, and bodyweight at week 156 only.
