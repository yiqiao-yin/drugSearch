We searched for reports published in any language up to Nov 13, 2013, using the search terms “exenatide” OR “liraglutide” OR “albiglutide” OR “dulaglutide” OR “semaglutide” OR “ITCA650” AND “type 2 diabetes mellitus” AND “years”, restricting our search to the “clinical trial” publication type. This search yielded reports of ﬁ ve clinical trials. 17–21 The duration of four17,19–21 of the identiﬁ  ed  studies was about 26 weeks. None of the studies involved long-term treatment (1–2 years) with a control group in place throughout the study period. Interpretation To our knowledge, ours is the longest prospective trial of a longacting GLP-1 receptor agonist with a comparator group maintained throughout the study duration. We have shown that HbA 1c control is better with exenatide once weekly than
