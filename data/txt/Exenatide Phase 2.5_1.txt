maximally effective (MAX) or minimum recommended (MIN) doses of sulfonylurea. RESULTS — Week 30 A1C changes from baseline ( /H11006SE) were /H110020.8/H110060.1% (10 /H9262g),/H110020.6/H11006 0.1% (5 /H9262g), and /H110010.2/H110060.1% (placebo; adjusted P/H110210.0001 vs. placebo), yielding placebo- adjusted reductions of /H110021.0% (10 /H9262g) and /H110020.8% (5 /H9262g). In the evaluable population, ex- enatide-treated subjects were more likely to achieve A1C /H113497% than placebo-treated subjects (34% [10 /H9262g], 27% [5 /H9262g], and 9% [placebo]; P/H110210.0001). Both exenatide arms demonstrated signiﬁcant weight loss (/H110021.6 /H110060.2 kg from baseline each exenatide arm, /H110020.9/H110060.2 kg placebo; P/H113490.01 vs. placebo). Mild or moderate nausea was the most frequent adverse event. The incidence of mild/moderate hypoglycemia was 28% (10 /H9262g), 19% (5 /H9262g), and 13% (placebo) and appeared lower with MIN than with MAX sulfonylurea treatment.
