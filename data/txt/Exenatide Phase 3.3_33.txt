receptor agonists (ie, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea) were reported more often in patients given exenatide than in those given glargine (table 3). Especially when taking into account the longer treatment period in the extension compared with the core treatment period (2·5 years vs 6 months), the frequency of these gastrointestinal events in patients given exenatide was lower during the extension period (weeks 26–156) than during the initial 26-week core treatment period (nausea: 16 [8%] of 193 who received study drug during the extension period vs 30 [13%] of 233; vomiting: six [3%] vs ten [4%]; diarrhoea: 17 [9%] vs 20 [9%]). Injection-site  reactions were also reported more frequently in patients given exenatide than in those given glargine (table 3). Three cases of acute pancreatitis were reported, two in the exenatide group and one in the glargine group, and all were serious adverse events. The exposure-adjusted rate of overall hypoglycaemia
