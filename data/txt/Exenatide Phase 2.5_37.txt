demonstrated that exenatide therapy im-proved glycemic control in patients withtype 2 diabetes inadequately controlledon maximal doses of combined met-formin-sulfonylurea therapy. Exenatideadded to metformin-sulfonylurea therapywas associated with weight loss and wasgenerally well tolerated. The addition ofexenatide resulted in similar beneﬁcial ef-fects in patients whose sulfonylurea dosewas initially reduced to minimally effec-tive doses, with later titration, when com-pared with patients using ﬁxed maximallyeffective doses of sulfonylurea through-out the study.
