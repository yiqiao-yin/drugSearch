95% CI 0·08–0·33) not meeting predeﬁ  ned non-inferiority criteria (upper limit of CI <0·25%). The most common  adverse events were nausea (93 [21%] in the liraglutide group vs 43 [9%] in the exenatide group), diarrhoea  (59 [13%] vs 28 [6%]), and vomiting 48 [11%] vs 17 [4%]), which occurred less frequently in the exenatide group and  with decreasing incidence over time in both groups. 24 (5%) patients allocated to liraglutide and 12 (3%) allocated to exenatide discontinued participation because of adverse events. Interpretation Both once daily liraglutide and once weekly exenatide  led to improvements in glycaemic control, with  greater reductions noted with liraglutide. These ﬁ  ndings, plus diﬀ   erences in injection frequency and tolerability,  could inform therapeutic decisions for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.
