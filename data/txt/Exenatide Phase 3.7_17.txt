stratum, week, and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed factors; and baseline HbA1c as a continuous covariate. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model within-patient errors. Secondary and exploratory endpoints were analysed using MMRM analyses or analysis of covariance (continuous variables) or a Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel test stratified by baseline HbA1c stratum and sulphonylurea-use stratum (categorical variables). All efficacy analyses, with the exception of SBP, excluded measurements afterrescue therapy initiation or after premature discontinuation of study treatment; SBP analyses included measurements after rescue therapy initiation and excluded measurements after premature discontinua- tion of study treatment. Safety data were assessed in the safety analysis set, defined as all randomized patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug, and were summarized descriptively with all AEs coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 19.0.
