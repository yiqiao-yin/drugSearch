percent of all patients achieved reduc- tions in A1C over 52 weeks (similar be-tween cohorts) and most patients (77and 79% of exenatide QW-only and ex-enatide BID 3exenatide QW, respec- tively) achieved reductions in both A1Cand body weight. Signiﬁcant A1C re-ductions were observed in both treat-ment groups regardless of weight loss Figure 2— Glycemic control and body weight over 52 weeks. A: Least squares mean /H11006SE changes in A1C over 52 weeks for the evaluable population (exenatide QW-only n/H11005120; exenatide BID 3exenatide QW n/H11005121). B: Least squares mean /H11006SE change in A1C for ITT ( n/H11005148) and evaluable population patients receiving only exenatide QW for 52 weeks. C: Change in fasting plasma glucose over 52 weeks for the evaluable population. D: Proportion of patients achieving A1C targets of /H110217.0,/H113496.5, and /H113496.0%. E: Least squares mean /H11006SE changes in body weight over 52 weeks for the
