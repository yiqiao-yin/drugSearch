The incidence of serious (2.7, 4.5, and 3.5% for 10- /H9262g, 5-/H9262g, and placebo arms, respectively) and severe (9.7, 11.8,and 8.8% in the 10- /H9262g, 5-/H9262g, and placebo arms, respectively) treatment-emergentadverse events was low and evenly dis-tributed across treatment arms. The mostfrequent adverse events were mild ormoderate and were gastrointestinal in na-ture (Table 1). Nausea was the most fre-quent severe adverse event, and it washigher in exenatide-treated subjects thanin placebo-treated subjects. Nausea wasgenerally mild or moderate in intensity,with the incidence of severe nausea (3.5,2.7, and 1.8% in the 10- /H9262g, 5-/H9262g, and
