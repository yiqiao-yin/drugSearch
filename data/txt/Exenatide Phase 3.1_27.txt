ments in glycemic control and bodyweight observed after 30 weeks of ex-enatide QW treatment (17) were sus-tained in patients continuing exenatideQW treatment for 52 weeks. Patientsswitching from exenatide BID to ex-enatide QW exhibited further improve-ments in glycemic control. Similarimprovements in glycemic control, bodyweight, and cardiovascular risk factorswere observed at week 52 regardless ofinitial randomized treatment. Althoughthe absence of a comparator arm is a lim-itation of this study and the open-labeltrial design inherently offers the potentialfor bias and can affect patient expecta-tions, the results of this study demon-strated reductions in A1C and body
