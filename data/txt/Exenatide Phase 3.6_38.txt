calcitonin concentrations did not change with treatment. Limitations of our study include the open-label design,  which could have aﬀ  ected patients’ expectations or behaviour. Moreover, the absence of systematically obtained pharmacokinetic data limits assessment of the reasons for our ﬁ  ndings.  In summary, treatment with either exenatide once  weekly or liraglutide once daily provided eﬀ  ective glucose  lowering combined with weight loss and minimum hypoglycaemic episodes in patients with type 2 diabetes. The diﬀ  erences noted between the clinical eﬃ   cacy of  liraglutide once daily and exenatide once weekly at the doses tested, together with frequency and method of injection, can be used by clinicians in shared decision making for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by oral anti hyperglycaemic drugs.
