in patients with type 2 diabetes naive to antidiabetic  agents and whose disease was inadequately controlled  with diet and exercise alone.  Methods: This 24-week, double-blind, placebo-  controlled, parallel-group study was conducted at  23 centers across the United States, Puerto Rico,  Romania, Russia, and India. Patients aged >18 years  with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to re-  ceive exenatide 5 pg, exenatide 10 pg, or placebo ad-  ministered SC BID. Patients were instructed by in-  vestigators to maintain their individualized prestudy  diet and exercise regimens throughout the study.  Efficacy measures included: glycosylated hemoglobin  (HbAI~); fasting serum glucose (FSG); 6-point self-  monitored blood glucose; percentages of patients  achieving HbAI~ values _<6.5% and _<7.0%; weight;  and homeostasis model of J3-cell function (HOMA-B,  a clinical measure of pancreatic J3-cell function). Tol-  erability measures included patient-reported adverse
