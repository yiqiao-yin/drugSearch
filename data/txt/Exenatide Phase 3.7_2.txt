mary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline to week 28. Secondary endpoints includedbody weight, 2-hour postprandial glucose, and mean daily IG dose.Results: Of 464 randomized patients (mean: age, 58 years; HbA1c, 8.5% [69 mmol/mol]; diabe- tes duration, 11.3 years), 91% completed 28 weeks. Exenatide QW + IG vs placebo + IG signif- icantly reduced HbA1c (least-squares mean difference, −0.73% [ −8.0 mmol/mol]; 95% confidence interval, −0.93%, −0.53% [ −10.2, −5.8 mmol/mol]; P<.001; final HbA1c, 7.55% [59 mmol/mol] and 8.24% [67 mmol/mol], respectively); body weight ( −1.50 kg; −2.17, −0.84; P<.001); and 2-hour postprandial glucose ( −1.52 mmol/L [ −27.5 mg/dL]; −2.15, −0.90 [ −38.7, −16.2]; P< .001). Significantly more exenatide QW + IG-treated patients vs placebo + IG- treated patients reached HbA1c <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) (32.5% vs 7.4%; P< .001); daily IG
