Figure 1 shows the trial proﬁ  le. 912 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either exenatide or liraglutide (one patient assigned to liraglutide withdrew before receiving study drug and was excluded from analysis; ﬁ  gure 1). 59 (13%) of 450 patients receiving liraglutide discontinued and 61 (13%) of 461 patients receiving exenatide discontinued before week 26 of the study (ﬁ  gure 1). In the ﬁ  rst 4 weeks of the study during titration, 15 patients in the liraglutide group discontinued because of treatment-emergent gastro-intestinal events versus none in the exenatide group. Baseline charac teristics were similar between groups (table 1). 0–2·0–1·5Least-squares mean change in HbA1c (%) –1·0–0·50 2468* *§‡† 10 12 14 Time (weeks)16 18 20 22 24 26Exenatide once weekly (n=461) Liraglutide once daily (n=450) Figure 2: Change in glycaemic control from baseline to week 26
