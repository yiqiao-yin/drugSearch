effects obtained with EQW monotherapyand MET monotherapy in terms of HbA 1c and body weight reductions support theappropriateness of considering MET astheﬁrst-line antihyperglycemic agent in type 2 diabetes. For example, the ADA/ EASD recommends MET as a ﬁrst-line agent; other antihyperglycemic agentsare added in stepwise fashion with disease progression after MET failure (1). Find- ings from DURATION-4 demonstrate that both EQW and PIO offer similar im-provements in glycemia as MET, with one key difference between these agents being the effect on body weight. Thus, healthcare practitioners have more treatment choices for drug-naive patients. Clinicians are advised to consider mul- tiple factors when treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Similar to previous studies evaluating PIO as monotherapy (3,13),patients treated with PIO in the currentstudy gained weight. EQW and MET led to similar signi ﬁcant reductions in body
