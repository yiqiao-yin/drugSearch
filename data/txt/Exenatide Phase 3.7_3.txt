dose increased by 2 and 4 units, respectively. Gastrointestinal and injection-site adverse eventswere more frequent with exenatide QW + IG (15.1% and 7.8%, respectively) than with pla- cebo + IG (10.8% and 3.0%, respectively); hypoglycaemia incidence was similar between the exenatide QW + IG (29.7%) and placebo + IG (29.0%) groups, with no major hypoglycaemicevents.Conclusions: Among patients with inadequate glycaemic control, exenatide QW significantly improved glucose control and decreased body weight, without increased hypoglycaemia or unexpected safety findings.
