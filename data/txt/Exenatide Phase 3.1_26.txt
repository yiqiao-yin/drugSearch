major hypoglycemia; the incidence of mi- nor hypoglycemia was low and was lim-ited to patients using a concomitant SFUduring weeks 30–52 (9% of patients re-ceiving an SFU) (supplementary Table 1,available in an online appendix). Anti-bodies to exenatide titer peaked at week 6for both treatment groups (geometricmean/H11006SE 33.2 /H110068.2 and 12.6 /H110063.4 for exenatide QW-only and exenatideBID3exenatide QW groups, respec- tively). At week 52, antibody titers to ex-enatide were 12.8 /H110063.4 and 8.9 /H110062.1 for exenatide QW-only and exenatideBID3exenatide QW groups, respectively (supplementary Table 2, available in anonline appendix). Antibodies to ex-enatide were not predictive of individualA1C change or incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. One patientwithdrew because of an adverse event(worsening of type 2 diabetes) during the22-week assessment period (exenatideQW-only group). No cases of pancreatitiswere reported.
