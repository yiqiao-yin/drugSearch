After a 1 week screening period, we used a computer-generated randomisation sequence with an interactive voice response system to randomly assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive injections of either liraglutide once daily (1·8 mg) or exenatide once weekly (2 mg). Ran domisation was stratiﬁ  ed by concomitant sulfonylurea treatment (with or without treatment), screening HbA 1c (<9·0% and  ≥9·0% [<75 mmol/mol and ≥75 mmol/mol]), and country. We used an open-label design because placebo was not available for once-daily liraglutide treatment. Procedures
