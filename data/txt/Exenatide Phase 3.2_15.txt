<7 % ( <5 3m m o l ⁄mol) and £6.5% ( £48 mmol ⁄mol) at week 52 compared with week 26 were observed forpatients who originally recei ved exenatide once-weekly or pioglitazone; signiﬁcantly mo re patients achieved both HbA 1c targets after switching from sit agliptin to exenatide once-weekly (Fig. 3). Exenatide once-weekly-only and pioglitazone ﬁexenatide once-weekly patients also maint ained fasting plasma glucose improvements from week 26 to week 52 (Fig. 3), while patientsoriginally randomised to sitaglip tin exhibited signiﬁcant further fasting plasma glucose improvements ( )0.7 mmol ⁄l; P= 0.0017). At the end of this assessment period, the proportion of patients who achi eved fasting plasma glucose £7 mmol ⁄l was unchanged with exenatide once-weekly-only (week 26 ﬁweek 52: 62% ﬁ62%) and following the switch from pioglitazone to exenatide once-weekly (week 26 ﬁ week 52: 59% ﬁ59%). Signiﬁcantly more patients achieved fasting plasma glucose £7m m o l ⁄l after switching from
