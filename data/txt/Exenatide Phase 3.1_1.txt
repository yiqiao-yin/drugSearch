tor-controlled, open-label trial, 258 patients entered the 22-week open-ended assessment phase(n/H11005128 QW-only; n/H11005130 BID3QW). A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, blood pressure, fasting lipids, safety, and tolerability were assessed. RESULTS — Patients continuing exenatide QW maintained A1C improvements through 52 weeks (least squares mean /H110022.0% [95% CI /H110022.1 to/H110021.8%]). Patients switching from exenatide BID to exenatide QW achieved further A1C improvements; both groups exhibited the same A1Creduction and mean A1C (6.6%) at week 52. At week 52, 71 and 54% of all patients achievedA1C/H110217.0% and /H113496.5%, respectively. In both treatment arms, FPG was reduced by /H1102240 mg/dl, and body weight was reduced by /H110224 kg after 52 weeks. Nausea occurred less frequently in this assessment period and was predominantly mild. No major hypoglycemia was observed. CONCLUSION — Exenatide QW elicited sustained improvements in glycemic control and
