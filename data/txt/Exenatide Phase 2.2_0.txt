B ARON,MD OBJECTIVE — AC2993 (synthetic exendin-4; exenatide) is a peptide that enhances glucose- dependent insulin secretion, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, and slowsgastric emptying. AC2993 also promotes /H9252-cell proliferation and neogenesis in vitro and in animal models. This study examines the activity and safety of subcutaneously injected AC2993in patients with type 2 diabetes currently treated with diet and/or oral antidiabetic agents(OAAs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 109 patients treated with diet and
