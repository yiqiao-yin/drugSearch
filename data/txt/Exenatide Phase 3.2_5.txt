once-weekly dosing with the gl ucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist exenatide resulted in superior improvements inglycaemic control and body weight compared with maximumapproved doses of the dipeptidyl pe ptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, sitagliptin, and the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone [3]. In the subsequent, open-label phase of the DURATION-2 trial, all patients received exe natide once-weekly. Rather than adding another medication, as is common in clinical practice,patients who originally received daily sitagliptin or pioglitazone discontinued their respective oral treatment to assess incrementalchanges in glycaemic control and body weight after switching toonce-weekly administration of e xenatide. Patients originally randomised to exenatide once-weekly continued treatment and discontinued oral placebo. In this open-label extension period, all
