The current study indicates that 28 days of AC2993 treatment reduces HbA 1c by/H110110.9% compared with baseline in pa- tients with type 2 diabetes not attainingHbA 1cgoals with oral agent therapy or diet. In addition, the proportion of pa- tients achieving the American DiabetesAssociation target HbA 1c/H110217% (31) was fourfold greater in the AC2993 arms. Given that HbA1conly fully reﬂects a change in glycemia 3 months after a sus- tained change has occurred, this reduc-tion in HbA 1cand enhanced ability to achieve clinically relevant HbA1ctarget values over 1 month are highly clinically signiﬁcant. Glucose proﬁles during ingestion of a mixed meal demonstrated a marked acuteeffect of AC2993 to reduce postprandialglycemia that was sustained over the 28-day observation period. This postprandial effect is likely mediated via three key ac-tions of AC2993 that have been observedin animal models of diabetes: 1) increased
