phy (HPLC), with a normal referencerange of 4.2–5.9%. The assay providesvalues comparable to those obtained inthe Diabetes Control and Complica-tions Trial (22). Cortisol was measuredby radioimmunoassay. Plasma AC2993concentrations were measured using animmunoenzymetric assay. Brieﬂy, mi-crotiter plates were coated with an anti-AC2993 monoclonal antibody (AmylinPharmaceuticals) at 4°C for 1–3 days.Nonspeciﬁc binding sites were blockedusing 1% nonfat dried milk diluted in0.05 mol/l carbonate buffer (pH 9.5).Samples were added to wells and incu-bated for 1–2 h at room temperature. Abiotinylated secondary monoclonal an-tibody (Amylin Pharmaceuticals) pre-incubated with streptavidin-alkalinephosphatase was added to each well andincubated at room temperature for 1–2h. Wells were washed with Tris-bufferedsaline/Tween (0.05 mol/l Tris, 0.15 mol/lsodium chloride, 0.02% sodium azide,and 0.1% Tween-20) between incubationsteps
