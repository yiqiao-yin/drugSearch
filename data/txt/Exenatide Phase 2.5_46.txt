when exenatide is administered to met-formin-treated patients, where you wouldexpect minimal background hypoglyce-mia risk, no increase in hypoglycemia isobserved despite a lowering of A1C (35).In the present study, the hypoglyemia ob-served seems most likely the result of anexenatide-induced improvement in gly-cemia superimposed upon the nonglu-cose-dependent actions of sulfonylureatreatment. The Ô¨Åndings further suggestthat a proactive approach to sulfonylureadose management will likely limit the in-cidences of hypoglycemia in exenatide-treated patients. That is, initial reductionof dosage of a sulfonylurea may limit therisk of hypoglycemia associated with suchtherapies upon initiation of exenatidetreatment. In summary, exenatide therapy sig-
