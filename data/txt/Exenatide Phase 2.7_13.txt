5 or 10 lag or an equivalent volume of placebo BID.  Patients randomly assigned to the exenatide 10-pg  group received 5 lag BID for the first 4 weeks and 10 lag  BID over the final 20 weeks. Patients who were ran-  domly assigned to receive placebo were administered  a volume equivalent to that of exenatide 5 lag BID  during the first 4 weeks and then a volume equivalent  to that of exenatide 5 or 10 lag BID for the final  20 weeks. Patients self-administered study drug SC in  the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen (these injection sites  have been reported to provide comparable bioavail-  ability of exenatide) 15 15 minutes before the morning  and evening meals. Patients were instructed by inves- tigators to maintain their individualized prestudy diet  and exercise regimens throughout the study.  Patients with an HbAI~ increase of 1.0% from base-  line at any study visit or an HbAI~ >10.5% at week  >12 were to be discontinued from the study due to
