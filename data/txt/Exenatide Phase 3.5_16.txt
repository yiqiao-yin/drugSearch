The proportions of patients achieving HbA1c and FPG targetswere compared between treatments using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusted by the factors of baseline HbA1c stra-tum and concomitant SU use at screening. Differences in thechanges in other parameters from baseline to wk 24 wereassessed using general linear models, including factors fortreatment group, concomitant SU use at screening, baselineHbA1c stratum, and baseline values of the parameter. Thetriglyceride data were analyzed after natural logarithmic transformation. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population (n /H11005252) consisted of all randomized patients receiving at least one dose of randomizedstudy medication. The evaluable population (n /H11005204) consisted
