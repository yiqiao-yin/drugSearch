release of insulin and amylin from the/H9252-cell (10); 2) suppression of the para- doxically high glucagon secretion ob-served in animals with diabetes (12); and3) slowing of the rate of gastric emptying (13). While no statistically demonstrableeffect on fasting plasma glucose was ob-served at day 28, day 14 fasting plasmaglucose in the AC2993 group was signif-icantly reduced compared with placebo(data not shown). The ability of AC2993to reduce fasting plasma glucose has pre-viously been reported to be secondary toenhanced insulin secretion (10) and sup-pression of inappropriately elevated glu-cagon secretion (12). In patients with type2 diabetes, GLP-1 has also been shown ina 6-week study to lower both fasting andpostprandial glucose (32). However, incontrast to AC2993, GLP-1 needed to becontinuously infused (32). The effects of AC2993 on postpran- dial and, to a lesser extent, fasting glyce-mia were the key factors leading to thechanges in fructosamine and HbA 1c(indi-
