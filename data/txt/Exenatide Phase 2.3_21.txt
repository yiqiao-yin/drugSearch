Baseline fasting insulin and proinsulinconcentrations were similar across treat-ment arms (Fig. 1), and there were nosigniﬁcant differences in fasting plasmainsulin concentrations across treatmentarms over the course of the study. How-ever, there was a signiﬁcant reduction infasting proinsulin concentrations in the10-/H9262g exenatide arm compared with baseline ( /H1100216 pmol/l, 95% CI /H1100226.1 to /H110026.0) and with placebo ( P/H110210.01), with a similar trend noted in the 5- /H9262g ex- enatide arm. Overall, there was a dose-dependent decrease in the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio toward more physiologicalproportions. Baseline proinsulin-to-insulin ratios were 0.66 /H110060.04, 0.59 /H11006 0.03, and 0.64 /H110060.04 in the 10- /H9262g ex- enatide, 5- /H9262g exenatide, and placebo arms, respectively. In the 10- /H9262g exenatidearm at week 30, the mean proinsulin-to- insulin ratio was reduced /H110020.13 com-
