T.J. Moretto et al.  measurements were determined based on FSG and  fasting serum insulin values using the HOMA 2 Cal-  culator version 2.2.2 (Oxford Center for Diabetes,  Endocrinology, and Metabolism, Oxford, United King-  dom). Antibodies to exenatide were measured using a  solid-phase ELISA, as previously described.19  Statistical Analysis  Randomization was stratified by screening HbAl~  values (_<8% and >8%) within each investigative site  to ensure a balanced distribution of patients within  these strata across treatment groups. A sample size of  60 patients per treatment group who were expected to  complete treatment through week 24 was estimated to  provide >90% power to reject the null hypothesis of  no difference among treatments assuming true mean  changes in HbAI~ of-0.5%,-0.7%, and 0% in pa-  tients receiving exenatide 5 pg, exenatide 10 pg, and  placebo, respectively, with a common SD of 1.0% and  a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. In addition, it was
