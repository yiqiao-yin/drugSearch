subjects who were ultimately receiving the same dosefollowing dose-escalation, thus conﬁrming the utility ofthe dose-escalation strategy to ameliorate side effects tothis peptide. Therefore, this dose-escalation approach was effective. Fasting serum glucose concentrations progressively decreased in the exenatide-primed arm during theﬁrst 35-day dosing phase, in parallel with incremental increases in exenatide dose. By the end of the 35- day dosing phase, mean fasting serum glucose in theexenatide-primed arm was 34% lower than at baseline.In contrast, no change in fasting glucose concentrations were observed in placebo-treated subjects during the 35-day dosing phase. These results further support theglucoregulatory effects of exenatide reported in humans[1,2]. Most importantly, the progressive reduction infasting serum glucose observed in the exenatide-primed arm underscores the important observation that the
