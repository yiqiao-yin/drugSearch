open-label treatment period. Patients who switched frompioglitazone to exenatide once-weekly signiﬁcantly reducedHDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol andincreased triglycerides. Of the 132 patients who used a lipid-lowering agent at the start of the 26-week open-label assessmentperiod, 121 patients (91, 89 and 95% of patients originallyrandomised to exenatide once-weekly, sitagliptin and pioglitazone, respectively) did not change dose and 13 patients (n= 3 exenatide once-weekly-only; n= 5 sitagliptin ﬁ exenatide once-weekly; n= 5 pioglitazone ﬁexenatide once-weekly) started a lipid-lowering medication after the start of the open-label period. Exenatide once-weekly for 52 weeks was associated with improvements in the urinary albumin ⁄creatinine ratio, B-type natriuretic peptide and high-se nsitivity C-reactive protein ( Table 2). Although the mean urinary albumin ⁄creatinine ratio
