values from baseline were /H110020.77/H110060.08% (10- /H9262g arm; adjusted P/H110210.0001 vs. placebo), /H110020.55/H110060.07% (5- /H9262g arm; adjusted P/H110210.0001 vs. placebo), and/H110010.23/H110060.07% (placebo arm). C: Week 30 change in A1C stratiﬁed by baseline A1C. For subjects with baseline A1C /H110219%, baseline A1C values were 7.92/H110060.04% (n /H11005169), 7.91 /H110060.04% (n /H11005172), and 7.94 /H110060.04% (n /H11005172) for the 10- /H9262g exenatide, 5- /H9262g exenatide, and placebo arms, respectively. The corresponding values for subjects with baseline A1C /H113509% were 9.86 /H110060.07% (n /H1100572), 9.75 /H110060.07% (n /H1100573), and 9.75 /H110060.07% (n /H1100575).D: Effects of exenatide on body weight. Subjects in the 10- /H9262g exenatide b.i.d. treatment arm received 5 /H9262g exenatide b.i.d. during weeks 0 – 4. Subjects in all treatment
