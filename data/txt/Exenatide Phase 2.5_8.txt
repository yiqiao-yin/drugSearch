cretins, are currently being investigated as potential therapies for type 2 diabetes(14). Exenatide (exendin-4) is a 39–amino acid peptide incretin mimetic that exhib-its glucoregulatory activities similar to themammalian incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (15–19). The pres-ent study evaluated the ability of exena-tide to improve glycemic control in pa-tients with type 2 diabetes unable toachieve adequate glycemic control de-spite treatment with combined metfor-min-sulfonylurea therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Subjects were 22–77 years of age with type 2 diabetes treatedwith metformin and a sulfonylurea. Gen-eral inclusion criteria were a screeningfasting plasma glucose concentration/H1102113.3 mmol/l, BMI 27–45 kg/m 2, inclu - sive, and an A1C value of 7.5–11.0%. Themetformin dose was /H113501,500 mg/day, and
