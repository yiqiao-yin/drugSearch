sessed further without additional data points. In conclusion, in these patients with type 2 diabetes who were naive to anti- hyperglycemic therapy, all four treatmentsresulted in improvements in HbA 1c, and a majority of EQW-, MET-, and PIO-treated patients achieved a target HbA 1cof ,7.0%. This study recognizes that guide- lines typically recommend MET as the ﬁrst agent used, because it is inexpensive andsupported by long-term data. Of theagents studied, EQW and MET provided similar improvements in glycemic control along with the bene ﬁt of weight reduction and no increased risk of hypoglycemia. There were no unexpected ﬁndings with regard to safety or tolerability. Based onthese 26-week data, EQW is a once- weekly dosing option for initial therapy. Longer-term studies will be required toassess the durability of the observationsin this study.
