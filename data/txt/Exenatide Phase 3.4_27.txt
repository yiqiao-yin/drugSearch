and tolerability were consistent with pre- vious studies, including the observance of gastrointestinal adverse events in patientstreated with EQW and MET, and hyper- tension and peripheral edema with PIO (3,5,6,10,17,20,22 –24). Most notably, the safety pro ﬁle of EQW in the current trial was consistent with previous DURA- TION studies (6,10,17), with low rates of conﬁrmed minor hypoglycemia and few patients discontinuing treatment due to nausea (one patient) and vomiting (zero patients). Less nausea and vomiting withEQW have previously been reported in head-to-head studies versus exenatide BID. In general, hypoglycemia incidenceand incidence of serious adverse events were low across all treatment groups dur- ing the current study. The small percent-age (2%) of patients experiencing minorhypoglycemia with EQW monotherapy was similar to that observed with EQWTable 1dTreatment-emergent adverse events reported in ‡5% of patients in any treatment group EQW MET PIO SITA n 248 246 163 163
