continuous GLP-1 receptor agonism achieved with ExQW therapy demonstrated superiority to ExBID in reducingHbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes (16). Although meanimprovements in HbA1c were greater in the DURATION-1study, the magnitude of the difference between ExQW andExBID was greater in the current study and the reductions inHbA1c observed in the current 24-wk study are consistentwith those observed in two 26-wk studies of ExQW[DURATION-2 and DURATION-3 (23, 24)] and in previ- ous studies of ExBID (25â€“28). In some rodent models, long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists have been demonstrated to activate thyroid Ccells, resulting in calcitonin secretion (29). In the currentstudy, continuous exenatide exposure via ExQW treat-ment did not affect mean calcitonin concentrations over24 wk. This result is consistent with observations in pri-mate models and in patients with type 2 diabetes treatedfor 2 yr with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (29).
