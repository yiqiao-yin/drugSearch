enatide), a 39–amino acid peptide, exhib-its many desirable features of a novelantidiabetic therapy, including glucose-dependent enhancement of insulin secre-tion (9–11), suppression of inappropri-ately high glucagon secretion (12), andslowing of gastric-emptying rate (13),which may be paradoxically acceleratedin people with diabetes (14). At leastsome of these antidiabetic actions (e.g.,enhancement of insulin secretion) may bemediated by binding of AC2993 to thepancreatic glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor (15). Also, in animaland in vitro models, AC2993 and GLP-1have been shown to promote /H9252-cell pro-
