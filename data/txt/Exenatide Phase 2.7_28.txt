Blood Pressure and Fasting Serum Lipids  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were  comparable across treatment groups at baseline, with  means of 129 to 131 and 78 to 79 mm Hg, respec-  tively. Mean (SE) systolic blood pressure decreased  from baseline to end point by -3.7 (1.2) mm Hg in  both the exenatide 5- and 10-pg groups (both, P =  0.037) compared with -0.3 (1.2) mm Hg with place-  bo.
