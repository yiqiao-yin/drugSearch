1c recorded for the  exenatide group is probably not due to more frequent addition of oral agents, because a diﬀ  erence between the  groups was recorded before such alterations were allowed and the diﬀ  erence was maintained. Our ﬁ  ndings are likely to be clinically relevant because  clinical guidelines recommend basal insulin as a component of treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes and insuﬃ   cient glycaemic control on two-drug therapy. 30  Key assumptions of the guidelines are that progressive β-cell loss will necessitate the eventual transition to insulin therapy (particularly for patients with HbA 1c  concentrations ≥8·5% [69 mmol/mol]) and that insulin can be inﬁ  nitely titrated to achieve HbA 1c control.30  However, clinical trial data show that GLP-1 receptor agonists lower HbA 1c to a greater extent than does  glargine,31 even in a subgroup of patients with HbA1c  concentrations of 8·5% (69 mmol/mol) or higher.32 Our
