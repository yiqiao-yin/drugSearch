week 46 in compliance with the protocol and received adequate study medication exposure i n this assessment period ( ‡145 days of exenatide once-weekly; £2 doses missed during the last 2 months). There were no substantial differences in HbA 1c between the exenatide once-weekly-only 52-week evaluable and intent-to-treat populations ( Fig. 1); therefore, demographics and the analysis of non-safety endpoints are provided for the 52-weekevaluable population. Analyses of change in HbA 1cfrom baseline to weeks 26 and 52 were based on a general linear model, including factors fortreatment, country and baseline HbA 1cstratum. Change in HbA 1cduring the open-label phase (weeks 26–52) was analysed based on a general linear model, including factors for treatment, country and HbA 1cvalues at week 26 as a covariate. Analyses of change in other variables from baseline to weeks 26 and 52 werebased on a general linear model, including factors for treatment,country, baseline HbA
