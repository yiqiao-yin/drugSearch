in the placebo, 0.1- µg/kg exenatide, or 0.2-µg/kg exenatide groups. For patients receiving exenatide doses of>0.2  µg/kg, a dose-dependent in- crease in nausea was observed. Thefrequency of nausea was 14% (1/7),13% (1/8), 0% (0/7), 29% (2/7), and60% (3/5) in the placebo and 0.1-,0.2-, 0.3-, and 0.4- µg/kg exenatide groups, respectively. With the 0.4- µg/kg exenatide dose, two patients had symptoms consistent with pos-Figure 1. Exenatide pharmacokinetics. (A) Mean ± S.D. (bars) plasma exenatide concentra- tions in study A ( n = 8). The 0.4- µg/kg exenatide-treated group had significantly higher plasma concentrations of exenatide than did other exenatide-treated groups ( p ≤ 0.02). (B) Mean ± S.D. (bars) plasma exenatide concentrations in study B ( n = 8). Exenatide AUC0–5 hr and Cmax were significantly different for all pairwise dose comparisons ( p < 0.0001).
