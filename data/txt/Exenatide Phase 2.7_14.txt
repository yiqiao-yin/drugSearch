loss of glycemic control. Additionally, patients who  had >4 fasting serum glucose (FSG) concentrations  >260 mg/dL over 7 consecutive days on self-monitored  blood glucose (SMBG) testing were to be discontinued  from the study due to loss of glycemic control.  Study End Points  The primary end point was change from baseline in  HbAlc at end point (week 24 or last observation car-  ried forward). Secondary end points included the per-  centages of patients achieving HbAI~ <6.5% and <7.0%;  FSG concentration; 6-point SMBG concentrations,  determined using commercially available blood glu-  cose meters before and 2 hours after the start of the  morning, midday, and evening meals; weight; homeo-  stasis model of [3-cell function (HOMA-B, a clinical  measure of pancreatic [3-cell function based on a  structural computer model of the glucose-insulin feed-  back system in the overnight-fasted state)16; and toler-  ability. Tolerability measures included patient-reported
