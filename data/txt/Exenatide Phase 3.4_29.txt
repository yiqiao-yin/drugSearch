adjunct to MET in previous clinical trials (0–3%) (6,7,10,17). Most treatment- emergent adverse events in this study had resolved by the end of the 10-weeksafety follow-up period, with few treatment- emergent adverse events starting during the safety follow-up. There were several limitations to this study. First, patients were enrolled based on speci ﬁc criteria and were followed according to the study schedule, which may not re ﬂect real-world use. Second, no speci ﬁc compliance data were collected; however, patient-reported outcomes in-dicated that both oral and injectable therapies were associated with increases in treatment satisfaction and quality of lifein these previously drug-naive patients. Additionally, 26 weeks is too short a study duration to evaluate long-term gly-cemic control, weight loss, and b-cell preservation (25). For example, potential implications of the upward shift in HbA 1c, observed in the EQW group betweenweeks 16 and 26 (Fig. 2 A), cannot be as-
