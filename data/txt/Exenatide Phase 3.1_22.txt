lipidsClinically signiÔ¨Åcant blood pressure im-provements were observed in patientstreated with exenatide QW for 52 weeks(least squares mean [95% CI] from base-line: systolic blood pressure [SBP] /H110026.2 mmHg [95% CI /H110028.5 to/H110023.9 mmHg], and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] /H110022.8 mmHg [ /H110024.3 to/H110021.3 mmHg]) and in patients switching from exenatide BID toexenatide QW (SBP /H110023.8 mmHg [ /H110026.1 to/H110021.5 mmHg] and DBP /H110021.8 mmHg [/H110023.2 to/H110020.3 mmHg]) (Fig. 3 A). Fifty and 46% of patients (exenatide QW andexenatide BID 3exenatide QW, respec- tively) with elevated SBP ( /H11350130 mmHg)at baseline achieved normal SBP at week
