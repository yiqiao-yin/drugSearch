entiation in plasma exenatide con-centrations 30 minutes postdose be-tween the three s.c. doses. AUC 0–5 hr and maximum concentration( Cmax) were statistically different for allpairwise comparisons of exenatidegroups with the placebo group ( p <0.0001) (Figure 1B). For the 0.02-, 0.05-, and 0.1- µg/kg exenatide doses, the corresponding geometric meanAUC 0–5 hr values were 9,364, 23,224, and 41,387 pg • min/mL, respective- ly, and the corresponding geometricmean C max values were 45, 109, and 187 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma ex-enatide half-life ( t ½) and time to reach maximum concentration ( tmax) were not significantly affected by ex-enatide dose. Mean t ½ values ranged from 3.3 to 4.0 hours, while meant max values ranged from 2.1 to 2.2 hours. Pharmacodynamics.  In study A,
