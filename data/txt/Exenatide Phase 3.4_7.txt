after the ﬁrst dose of study drug. Minor hypoglycemia was de ﬁned as signs or symptoms associated with blood glucose,3.0 mmol/L (either self-treated or re- solved independently). Major hypoglyce- mia was classi ﬁed as symptoms resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure that showed prompt recovery after administra- tion of glucose, or documented blood glu-cose,3.0 mmol/L that required the assistance of another person because of severe impairment in consciousness or be- havior. A subset, de ﬁned as symptoms of hypoglycemia, was not con ﬁrmed by blood glucose measurement. Sample size determination The protocol speci ﬁed that 822 patients be enrolled, with at least 740 patients(10% dropout before ﬁrst HbA 1ccollec- tion) available for primary analysis. A sample of 740 patients (222 EQW and MET, 148 PIO and SITA) would provide;90% power to detect true differences in HbA 1cchange of 0.4% (EQW vs. MET), 0.5% (EQW vs. PIO), and 0.5% (EQW vs.SITA), respectively (two-sided ttest sig-
