177 Am J Health-Syst Pharm—Vol 62  Jan 15, 2005REPORTS Type 2 diabetes mellitus In part 1 of study B, there was no statistically significant difference inplasma glucose curves between the0.01- µg/kg exenatide and placebo groups. In part 2 of study B, exena-tide dose-dependently reduced post-prandial glucose levels ( p < 0.05) (Fig- ure 2B), and the baseline-adjustedAUC 0–5 hr for all exenatide groups were significantly lower than placebo(p < 0.05). Mean AUC 0–5 hr values were 1072, 918, and 828 mg • hr/dLfor the 0.02-, 0.05-, and 0.1- µg/kg ex- enatide groups, respectively, com-pared with 1150 mg  • hr/dL for the placebo group. The correspondingmean C max values were 285, 245, and 230 mg/dL, respectively, comparedwith 300 mg/dL for placebo.Baseline-adjusted C max values for the 0.05- and 0.1- µg/kg, but not the 0.02-µg/kg, exenatide groups were significantly lower than placebo ( p ≤ 0.002). Mean tmax values ranged from
