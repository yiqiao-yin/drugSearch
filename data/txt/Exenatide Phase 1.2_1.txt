tistically significant reductions in mean postprandial circu-lating concentrations of glucose, insulin, and glucagon oc-curred following treatment with AC2993. In study B, 13subjects receiving a single dose of study medication (0.05, 0.1,or 0.2 /H9262g/kg AC2993 or placebo) following an overnight fast had reduced fasting plasma glucose concentrations duringthe subsequent 8-h period. The relative glucose and insulin
