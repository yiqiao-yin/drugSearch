Kaplan–Meier plots for the proportion of subjects experiencing all nausea. Nausea incidence at Day 43 was lowerin the exenatide-primed arm. Analysis up to Day 43 (the dayafter the last dose day for the last subject) yielded values of 0.73for the exenatide-naive arm and 0.48 for the exenatide-primedarm ( p= 0.0047). Because the s tudy design allowed a ±1-day window for each visit, there was some variation in the actualday the subjects in both arms received the initial 0 .24µg/kg exenatide dose vomiting. The next most frequent gastrointestinal adverse event was diarrhea, reported in 6 subjects (9.8%) in the exenatide-naive arm and 10 subjects (16.1%) in theexenatide-primed arm. Of the subjects reporting diarrhea, 2 subjects in the exenatide-primed arm reported 3 severe events. All other diarrhea events were rated mild ormoderate.
