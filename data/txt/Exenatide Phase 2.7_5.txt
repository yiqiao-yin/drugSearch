T.J. Moretto et al.  -3.7 [1.2] [P = 0.037]; diastolic, 10 lag,-2.3 [0.7]  [P = 0.046]) versus placebo (systolic,-0.3 [1.2]; dia-  stolic, -0.3 [0.7]). Overall, 25% of patients reported  >1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Nausea was re-  ported with the greatest incidence (5 pg, 3%; 10 pg,  13%; placebo, 0%; P = 0.010 for the combined ex-  enatide group vs placebo). Most (88%) treatment-  emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in  intensity. Hypoglycemia was reported in 5%, 4%, and  1% of patients in the exenatide 5- and 10-pg and pla-  cebo groups, respectively (P = NS), with no incidents  of severe hypoglycemia reported.  Conclusions: In these patients with type 2 diabetes  naive to treatment with antidiabetic agents, exenatide  monotherapy was associated with improved HbAI~ ,  improved fasting and postprandial glucose control,  reduced weight, improved J3-cell function (HOMA-B),  and improved blood pressure, and was well tolerat-
