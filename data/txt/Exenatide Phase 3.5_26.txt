baseline to wk 24 were observed inExQW patients [LS mean change (95%CI)/H110022.9 (/H110025.2,/H110020.7) mm Hg]; nonsig- nificant changes in SBP were also ob-served in ExBID patients [ /H110021.2 (/H110023.5, 1.2) mm Hg; Table 2]. No significantchange in diastolic blood pressure wasobserved in either treatment arm. Largerimprovements in SBP [ExQW: /H110027.9 (/H1100211.3,/H110024.5) mm Hg and ExBID: /H110027.7 (/H1100211.3,/H110024.0) mm Hg] were observed in patients with elevated baseline SBP ( /H11350 130 mm Hg; Table 2). Significant reduc-tions in mean fasting total cholesteroland low-density lipoprotein cholesterolwere observed with ExQW; no signifi-cant changes in mean lipid parameterswere observed with ExBID. Relativelyfew subjects ( /H110115%) adjusted antihyper- tensive or lipid-lowering medication reg-imens during the study. Safety and tolerability Nausea, the adverse event reported
