study, sulfonylurea dose could be re-duced by 50%, regardless of the subject’sassigned sulfonylurea managementgroup, in the event of one documentedhypoglycemic event (blood glucose con-centration /H110213.3 mmol/l) or two undocu- mented suspected hypoglycemic events.Further 50% reductions, including com-plete cessation of sulfonylurea dose, wereallowed upon repetition of the previouscriteria. In subjects assigned to the MINgroup, if a majority of fasting plasmaglucose readings exceeded 6.9 mmol/lduring weeks 4–6, 6–9, or 9–12, theinvestigator was to consider doubling thesulfonylurea dose. No further escalationof sulfonylurea dose was permitted afterweek 12. Any subject with either an A1Cchange of /H110011.5% from baseline at any clinic visit or an A1C /H1135011.5% at week 18
