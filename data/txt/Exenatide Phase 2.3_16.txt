(Fig. 1). All subjects were treated with a sulfonylurea (45% glipizide, 33% gly-buride, 20% glimepiride, 1% tolazamide,and 0.3% chlorpropamide). Thirty-nine percent of ITT subjects were also treatedwith an ACE inhibitor, 34% with an anti-thrombotic agent, and 37% with a serum lipidâ€“reducing agent. HbA 1cand plasma glucose HbA1cvalues declined in all treatment arms during the period between screen- ing and randomization, averaged 8.6% atbaseline, and were comparable acrosstreatment arms (Fig. 2 A). HbA 1cvalues declined in both exenatide arms during the initial 12 weeks of the study, in con-trast to relatively little change in the pla-cebo arm. Thereafter, HbA 1cvalues in the exenatide arms plateaued, followed by a slight rise toward baseline by the end ofthe study in parallel with a similar changein the placebo arm. At week 30, the HbA 1c change from baseline was /H110020.86/H11006 0.11% in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm and /H110020.46/H110060.12% in the 5- /H9262g exenatide
