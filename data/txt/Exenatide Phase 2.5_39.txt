The latter effect has beenshown in some but not all studies, andthere is some question as to whether theapparent insulin sensitizing effect, if ob-served, is an indirect consequence ofoverall improved metabolic control andtherefore reduced glucotoxicity or an ac-tual direct effect. In the current trial, the observation of
