(<53 mmol/mol) without body weight gain at week 28 and without hypoglycaemia over 28 weeks. C, LSM change in 2-hour PPG from baseline to week 28. D, Mean FPG from screening to week 28. E, Mean insulin dose from screening to week 28. F, LSM change in body weight fromscreening to week 28. *Nominal P< .001 based on mixed-effects model for repeated measures analysis of change from baseline, including treatment, region, baseline HbA1c stratum (<9.0% or ≥9.0% [<75 or ≥75 mmol/mol]), baseline sulphonylurea use stratum, week and treatment- by-week interaction as fixed factors and baseline value as a covariate. †Screening visit (S) was a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 14 days before the week −8 visit. Values for HbA1c, FPG and IG dose are observed values at each time point. Error bars show mean /C6SE. These
