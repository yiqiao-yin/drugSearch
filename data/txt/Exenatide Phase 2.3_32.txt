body weight that did not appear to pla-teau by week 30. This progressive weightloss is consistent with the known ability ofexenatide to reduce food intake (12,29).Nausea may be suspected to be the causefor the weight loss; however, the inci-dence of nausea was greatest in the ﬁrstfew weeks following initiation of therapy,whereas weight loss was progressive over30 weeks. Moreover, subjects who neverreported nausea also lost weight, thus em-phasizing the dissociation of the two ef-fects. Although the effect on plasma lipidswas not a primary objective of the study,the effect of exenatide to improve overallglycemia while causing weight loss, mostsigniﬁcantly in the 10- /H9262g arm, leads one to anticipate potential effects on circulat-ing lipids. That said, there was a smallreduction in LDL cholesterol and apoli-poprotein B levels, but other lipid param-eters were unchanged. Overall, exenatide was generally well
