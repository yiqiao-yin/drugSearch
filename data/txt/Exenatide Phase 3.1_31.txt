an elusive goal for many patients withtype 2 diabetes. Furthermore, improvingweight and cardiovascular risk markersand avoiding hypoglycemia are desiredcomponents of a diabetes treatment pro-gram. GLP-1R agonists were recently rec-ommended as second-step treatmentoption in patients in whom avoidance ofhypoglycemia or promotion of weightloss is a major concern (1). In the presentstudy, the transition from exenatide BIDto exenatide QW was made without addi-tional safety and tolerability concerns.Furthermore, the clinical beneﬁts of ex-enatide QW were maintained and re-sulted in a mean A1C of 6.6% after 52weeks of treatment.
