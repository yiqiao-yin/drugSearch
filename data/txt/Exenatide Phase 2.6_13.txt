Statistical analysis Randomization was stratiﬁed accordingto screening HbA 1cvalues ( /H110219.0% and /H113509.0%) to achieve a balanced distribu- tion of subjects across treatment arms (A, Figure 2— Glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and exenatide or placebo. A: HbA1cvalues over the course of the study in the intent-to-treat population. Baseline HbA1cvalues (mean /H11006SE) were 8.18 /H110060.09% in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm, 8.26 /H110060.11% in the 5-/H9262g exenatide arm, and 8.20 /H110060.10% in the placebo arm. B: Percentage of evaluable subjects achieving HbA1c/H113497% at week 30. Subjects in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm received 5 /H9262g exenatide
