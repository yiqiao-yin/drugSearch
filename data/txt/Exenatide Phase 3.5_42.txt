(38). Studies directly comparing the safety and efficacy ofExQW, liraglutide, and taspoglutide are warranted. Consistent with previous results with ExQW and lira- glutide (24, 35), ExQW was associated with a modestelevation in heart rate. Although such increases in heartrate might indicate risk of cardiovascular events, no asso-ciated cardiovascular events were noted in the currentstudy, and previous clinical trials have shown that ExQWtreatment was associated with improvements in bloodpressure and fasting lipids (18, 23, 24). Furthermore, ret- rospective analyses have suggested that patients treatedwith the ExBID were less likely to have cardiovascularevents or cardiovascular-related hospitalizations thannon-exenatide-treated patients (39, 40). The open-label design of the study represents an im-
