study showed greater reductions in HbA1c in the exenatide  group than in the glargine group across baseline HbA1c  categories, consistent with a previous analysis comparing GLP-1 receptor agonists with glargine across quartiles of baseline HbA 1c.33 The ability to inÔ¨Å  nitely titrate insulin  to achieve clinical goals is limited by the increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Therefore, GLP-1 receptor agonists might be an appropriate option to consider before insulin initiation, even in patients with very high HbA 1c,33 for  whom insulin is the treatment of choice.
