sulin secretion) may be mediated by AC2993 binding to theknown glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (20). Theseactions of AC2993 combined with its very high ( /H110221000-fold) in vivo potency relative to native GLP-1 (21, 22) make AC2993 an attractive pharmaceutical agent. Although GLP-1 andAC2993 appear to share certain glucose-lowering actions, itis apparent that not all actions of exendin-4 are predictable Abbreviations: AUC, Area under the curve; BID, administered twice daily; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; HbA1c, hemoglobin A1c; OAA, oral antidiabetic agent.0021-972X/03/$15.00/0 The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 88(7):3082–3089 Printed in U.S.A.
