values were compared using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Post hoc evaluation ofchange in body weight versus duration ofnausea was performed using regressionanalysis. Safety analysis All safety analyses were performed usingthe ITT population. Safety end points in-cluded adverse events, clinical laboratorytests, physical examination, 12-lead elec-trocardiogram, vital signs, and titering ofanti-exenatide antibodies. Treatment-emergent adverse events were deﬁned asthose occurring upon or after receiving theﬁrst randomized dose. The intensity of hy-poglycemic episodes was deﬁned as mild/moderate or severe. For mild/moderatehypoglycemia, subjects reported symp-toms consistent with hypoglycemia thatmay have been documented by a plasmaglucose concentration value (/H11021 3.33 mmol/l). For severe hypoglycemia, sub-jects required the assistance of anotherperson to obtain treatment for their hypo-glycemia, including intravenous glucoseor intramuscular glucagon. Assays
