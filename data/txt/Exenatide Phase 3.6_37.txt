vascular risk factors in patients given exenatide once weekly and liraglutide. Both treatment groups had signiﬁ  cant de creases from baseline in systolic blood  pressure and brain natriuretic peptide, but not in diastolic blood pressure or C-reactive protein. Similarly, lipid parameters did not diﬀ  er signiﬁ  cantly between  groups at endpoint. Other studies have shown similar results. 3,15,18,26 The eﬀ  ect of both GLP-1 receptor agonists  on cardiovascular events is being examined in large, long-term outcomes studies (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering [EXSCEL], ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01144338; and Liraglutide Eﬀ  ect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results [LEADER], NCT01179048). In our study, concentrations of total amylase and  pancreatic lipase were consistent with those from other studies, 10,17 with variations noted not predictive of gastro- intestinal symptoms. As in previous studies,10,17,28 mean
