nificantly improved a range of glycaemic measures, and reduced bodyweight vs placebo + IG. These improvements were observed withoutunexpected safety findings or increased hypoglycaemia vs placebo. In the DURATION-7 study, injection-site –related AEs occurred in both the exenatide QW + IG and placebo + IG groups. Othersustained-release injectable drug formulations requiring in vivo degra- dation are also associated with injection-site reactions, 31which might explain the occurrence of these reactions in both treatment groups,as both exenatide QW and placebo injections contained micro-spheres. However, the greater frequency of injection-site –related AEs with exenatide-containing microspheres compared with placebo-containing microspheres observed in both the DURATION-7 andDURATION-8 studies, 32especially among those with positive anti-TABLE 3 (Continued) AEs, n (%) Exenatide QW + IG (n = 232) Placebo + IG (n = 231) Duodenal ulcer 1 (0.4) 0 (0.0)
