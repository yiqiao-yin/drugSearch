of exenatide doses greater than 0 .2µg/kg approached 70% in early single dose-rising trials. The purpose ofthe current study was to use a rigorous study design from both clinical and statistical perspectives to evaluate whether a dose-escalation regimen could reduce theprimary dose-limiting adverse events of exenatide. Weused the current design because it offered subjectsin the two treatment arms comparable exposure to study procedures and captured the placebo effect in the exenatide-naive arm. Most importantly, this study designshowed that after approximately 40 days of cumulativeexposure to exenatide, the cumulative incidence of nausea and vomiting remained lower than that observed in the exenatide-naive arm with only 3 days of exposure toexenatide. As predicted, more subjects reported severenausea and vomiting when exposed to a ﬁrst-time dose of 0.24µg/kg exenatide (exenatide-naive arm) than did
