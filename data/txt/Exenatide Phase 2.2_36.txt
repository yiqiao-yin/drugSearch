AC2993 therapy. It is noteworthy thatfasting values of plasma glucose and insu-lin, which were used to calculate HOMA,were obtained before the morning dose ofAC2993 when plasma concentrations ofAC2993 were negligible, suggesting afundamental alteration in /H9252-cell function following AC2993 exposure. These dataare consistent with the extensive literaturedocumenting enhanced /H9252-cell function after treatment with exendin-4 in animalmodels of diabetes (16â€“18). AC2993 treatment was also associ- ated with a strong trend toward reducedpostprandial serum triglyceride concen-trations, as was also seen in previous,short-term clinical studies (36). Whilefasting lipid parameters tended to im-prove, there were no differences com-pared with placebo. Safety was evaluated using sponta- neous adverse event reporting andmonitoring of clinical laboratory mea-sures and vital signs. The most commonadverse events encountered were mild-to- moderate nausea and hypoglycemia. Nau-
