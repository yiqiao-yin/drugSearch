achieve long-term glycemic control for patients with type 2 diabetes, as they do not inhibit theprogressive nature of beta-cell dysfunction. 2,3 Failure of patients with type 2 diabetes toachieve glycemic targets with OAD monother-apy or combination therapy generally promptsinsulin therapy. However, this approach can beassociated with inadequate control of post-prandial hyperglycemia, risk of hypoglycemia,the need for complicated dose-titration regi-mens, and weight gain. 4–7 Exenatide (exendin-4) is a 39-amino acid pep- tide incretin mimetic that elicits a variety of ef-fects that are desirable for achieving glycemiccontrol. 8,9The actions of exenatide include glu- cose-dependent enhancement of insulin secre-tion 10–13and suppression of inappropriately ele- vated glucagon secretion,13,14as well as slowing of the gastric-emptying rate.15Exenatide may also be associated with reduced caloric intakeand reductions in body weight. 9,16,17In animal
