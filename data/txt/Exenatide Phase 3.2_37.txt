glucose control and body weight reduction, and similar fastingplasma glucose improvement, compared with sitagliptin. Theexenatide molecule in the sustained release (once-weekly)formulation used in the present study and twice dailyformulation are identical, and the primary mechanism for the enhanced efﬁcacy of exenatide once-weekly compared withsitagliptin during the ﬁrst 26 w eeks of this study [3] was likely due to the continuous exposure to therapeutic concentrations of exenatide ( /C2470 pm; [6]) achieved with once-weekly exenatide. Thus, the signiﬁcant improvement in HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight observed in the present study afterswitching from sitagliptin to exenatide once-weekly may beattributable to the continuous e xposure to higher circulating concentrations of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide. Pioglitazone, which exerts its anti-hyperglycaemic effects primarily through decreasing insulin resistance, resulted in a signiﬁcantly smaller HbA
