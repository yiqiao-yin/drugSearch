sulinotropism, glucose-dependentsuppression of glucagon secretion,and slowing of gastric emptying arethe principal acute actions of ex-enatide in these animal models. Thechronic effects of exenatide in thesemodels include reduced food intake,weight reduction, enhanced insulinsensitivity, and increased  Î²-cell mass.tion do not suppress the paradoxical postprandial rise of glucagon con-centrations observed in patients withdiabetes. 30 This lack of suppression results in an inappropriately lowinsulin:glucagon ratio in the portalvein, contributing to sustained ratesof excess hepatic glucose produc-tion. 31 Thus, by virtue of its ability to enhance endogenous insulin secre-tion while lowering glucagon secre-tion, exenatide tends to reestablish amore physiological and favorableportal vein insulin:glucagon ratiocompared with currently availableagents. The data reported here and previ- ously demonstrate a consistent,dose-dependent slowing of gastricemptying by s.c. exenatide adminis-tration.
