In the MIN group, sulfonylurea dose was /H1101164% of MAX sulfonylurea dose acrossall treatment arms at study outset (base-line). By week 2, MIN subjects reducedthe dose of sulfonylurea to a nadir of 30%of MAX dose across treatment arms. Thislow dose was maintained for severalweeks, then sulfonylurea doses graduallyincreased throughout the remainder ofthe study. At week 30, subjects on pla-cebo reached /H1101194% of MAX dose com- pared with /H1101179% of MAX dose in the exenatide arms. For the two sulfonylureadosing groups, there were similar overalleffects on A1C when comparing ex-enatide treatment arms with placebo, butthe MAX group had a slightly greater re-duction in A1C from baseline ( P/H11349 0.0001 for pairwise comparisons; Table2). However, the overall incidence of hy-poglycemia was lower in the MIN group,with a small attenuation of the effects onglycemic control. CONCLUSIONS â€” This study, con- ducted in a large subject population,
