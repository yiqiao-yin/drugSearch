concentrations were similar among treat-ment arms (Fig. 1). At week 30, fastingplasma glucose concentrations were re-duced/H110020.6/H110060.2 mmol/l in the 10-/H9262g exenatide arm and /H110020.5/H110060.2 mmol/l in the 5-/H9262g arm compared with an increase of/H110010.8/H110060.2 mmol/l in the placebo arm (P/H110210.0001 for pairwise comparisons; ITT population). Postprandial plasma glucose concen- trations were evaluated in the subset ofsubjects who underwent a standardizedmeal tolerance test (Fig. 1). At baseline,all subjects received a placebo injec-tion, and postprandial plasma glucosegeometric mean area under the curve(AUC) (15–180 min) values were similar across treatment arms (Fig. 3 A). At week 4, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in post-prandial plasma glucose geometric meanAUC (15–180 min) in both exenatide arms compared with the placebo arm (P /H11021 0.001), and this pattern was sustained atweek 30 (Fig. 3B; P/H110210.001 for pairwise
