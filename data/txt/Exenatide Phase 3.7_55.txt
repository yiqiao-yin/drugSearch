23In the DURATION-7 study, patients were ran- domized after IG titration had failed to lower HbA1c below 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) following an increase in mean insulin doses fromscreening to baseline of 39 to ~51 units, whereas IG dose titrationbegan after randomization in the AWARD-9 study, thus maximizing the combined glucose-lowering actions of IG and dulaglutide. While the DURATION-7, HARMONY-6 and AWARD-9 studies reported reduced glycaemia and body weight among GLP-1RA- treated patients, gastrointestinal AEs were higher with GLP-1RA treatment in all 3 studies. 22,23In DURATION-7, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting occurred in 5.2%, 4.7% and 0.4% of exenatide QW- treated patients and 3.9%, 3.5% and 1.3% of placebo-treated patients, respectively. In HARMONY-6, nausea, diarrhoea and vomit-ing occurred in 11.2%, 13.0% and 6.7% of albiglutide-treated patients and 1.4%, 4.3% and 1.4% of lispro-treated patients, respectively. 22In
