All summaries and analyses were basedon the intent-to-treat population. A totalof 109 patients were randomized and re-ceived at least one dose of study medica-tion. Twelve subjects withdrew from thestudy [three in placebo, four in AC2993BID (bd), two in AC2993 BID (bs), andthree in AC2993 TID], but were includedin the statistical analyses up until the timeof their withdrawal. Efﬁcacy end pointswere analyzed using a one-way ANOVAto test the null hypothesis of no differenceamong treatment groups versus the alter-native hypothesis of a difference amongtreatment groups. No data imputationwas employed. Pairwise comparisonswere also conducted between the AC2993arms and placebo. Pvalues /H113490.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Speciﬁc Pvalues are given in the text. The study was powered to detect a statistically signiﬁcant difference ( /H9251/H11005 0.05) of 30 /H9262mol/l in the change in fruc-
