(e.g. exenatide) elicit effects through the GLP-1 pathway;however, distinct differences exist in the mechanism of actionof these compounds. Namely, inhibition of the DPP-4 leads to a two- to threefold elevatio n of endogenous GLP-1, while administration of GLP-1 receptor agonists results in higherplasma concentrations of agent s that bind directly to the GLP-1 receptor. In a short-term trial by DeFronzo et al. comparing exenatide twice daily with sit agliptin [4], the postprandial circulating concentration of exenatide, which has similarpotency to GLP-1 [8,9], was approximately fourfold greaterthan the increase in postprandial GLP-1 achieved with sitagliptin (15 p m; [4]). The greater circulating GLP-1 receptor agonist concentration observed with exenatide twice daily in the studyby DeFronzo et al. [4] was associ ated with greater postprandial
