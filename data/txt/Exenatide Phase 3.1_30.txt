control after the switch to exenatide QW(mean rise in mean A1C was /H11011/H110010.1%). A1C values subsequently declined belowthose observed with 30 weeks of ex-enatide BID treatment and by week 44matched those observed with continuousexenatide QW treatment. Overall, theseﬁndings suggest that switching from ex-enatide BID to QW, although associatedwith a transient increase in glycemia, ul-timately leads to signiﬁcantly improvedglycemic control. Achieving glycemic targets remains
