deÔ¨Åned as mild/moderate or severe. For mild/moderate hypoglycemia, subjectsreported symptoms consistent with hypo-glycemia that may have been documentedby a plasma glucose concentration value/H110213.3 mmol/l. For severe hypoglycemia, subjects required the assistance of an-other person to obtain treatment for theirhypoglycemia, including intravenousglucose or intramuscular glucagon. Assays Plasma analytes and HbA 1cwere quanti - tated by Quintiles Laboratories (Smyrna,GA) using standard methods. HbA 1cwasmeasured using a high-performance liq- uid chromatography methodology(31,32). Serum insulin and proinsulinwere quantitated by Esoterix Endocrinol-ogy (Calabasas Hills, CA) by two-site im-munochemiluminometric assays. Intra-assay variability ranged from 3 to 12%and interassay variability from 7 to 14%.Cross-reactivities for the insulin assaywere/H110210.001% with IGF-I and IGF-II, /H110210.01% with C-peptide, and /H110210.1%
