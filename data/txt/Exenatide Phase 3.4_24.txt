1cconcentrations at 26 weeks of,7%. EQW demonstrated superiority to SITA and noninferiority to MET butnot to PIO with regard to HbA 1creduction at 26 weeks. The lack of noninferiority of EQW monotherapy compared with PIOmonotherapy was unexpected based onDURATION-2 study results, where EQW was superior to PIO on a background of MET (10), and the fact that the HbA 1cre- duction with PIO was greater than that re- ported in other PIO studies with a similar baseline HbA 1c(2,3,11 â€“14). Several dispa- rate factors could have contributed to the incongruent outcomes, including differen- ces in background therapy and mean dura-tion of type 2 diabetes. SITA treatment led to comparatively lesser glycemic improvement than the otheragents, which supports the contention thatthe increase in plasma glucagon-like peptide- 1 associated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition is not as effective as pharmaco-logical concentrations achieved with re- ceptor agonism (15,16). The similar
