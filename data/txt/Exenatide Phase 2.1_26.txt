lowing 28 days of therapy with other anti-dia-betes agents (e.g., sulfonylureas, metformin,meglitinides, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibi-tors, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase in-hibitors, inhaled insulin), either as the primaryend point of the study or as a time point in alonger trial. The reductions associated with ex-enatide herein are generally greater than thosedescribed in previously published reports forother glucose-lowering therapies, especiallycompared with patient populations that hadequivalent starting HbA 1cvalues,29–33or pre- vious therapy with diet modifications and ex-ercise alone 29,34–39or metformin.31,40–44Given that the baseline HbA 1cwas approximately 7.5%, the HbA 1creduction of 0.5% over 28 days observed with the 10.0 /H9262g b.i.d. dose is en- couraging, as it reflects patients approachingtarget values of /H110217%. 45In addition, this prompt effect on glycemia was accompanied by reduc-tions in body weight at each dose of exenatidestudied.
