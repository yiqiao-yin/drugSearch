180 Am J Health-Syst Pharm—Vol 62  Jan 15, 2005REPORTS Type 2 diabetes mellitus Chief among the acute mechanisms of action observed in animal modelsof diabetes is glucose-dependent in-sulinotropism (i.e., amplification of β-cell insulin release when glucose concentrations are above the normalrange but not when glucose concen-trations are below the normal range).The end result of glucose-dependentinsulinotropism is to increase the gainof glucose–insulin secretion couplingwhile maintaining the physiologicalglucose-sensing control mechanisms.This action of exenatide contrastswith the action of currently availableinsulin secretagogues or hypoglyce-mic agents, such as sulf onylureas, which increase insulin secretion re-gardless of glucose concentration 29 and thus have a higher potential toinduce hypoglycemia. 1 In the current study, plasma insu- lin concentrations appeared un-changed by administration of ex-enatide doses of <0.1  µg/kg, rising
