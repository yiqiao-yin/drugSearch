ing from exenatide BID to exenatide QWexperienced a transient elevation in FPG,which generally improved within 2 weeksafter initiation of QW therapy. This tran-sient rise in FPG can be largely attributedto the time required for plasma exenatidelevels to reach the therapeutic range afterinitiation of exenatide QW and was of amagnitude ( /H1101115 mg/dl) that is unlikely to be associated with symptoms or harmover a short period of time. In addition,subjects who switched treatment andwere using a concomitant SFU were re-quired to reduce their SFU dose to theminimum recommended dose for initia-tion of exenatide QW treatment. There-fore, the transient rise in FPGconcentration may also reﬂect SFU doseadjustments. It is important to note thatthe highest point in the transient FPG riserepresented a mean decrease of /H1100216 mg/dl from baseline. There was no clini-cally signiﬁcant effect on overall glycemic
