HbA 1cand plasma glucose HbA1cvalues declined in all treatment arms during the placebo lead-in period and the initial 2 weeks of the study afterrandomization (Fig. 2 A). At week 4, sig- niﬁcant reductions in HbA 1cfrom base - line were observed in both exenatidetreatment arms compared with placebo(P/H110210.0005). At week 30, a signiﬁcant dose-dependent reduction in HbA 1cwas observed in both exenatide-treated arms compared with placebo ( P/H110210.001, over- allFtest). For intent-to-treat subjects at week 30 with baseline HbA1c/H110227%, 40% (41 subjects) in the 10- /H9262g exenatide arm and 27% (27 subjects) in the 5- /H9262g exenatide arm reached an HbA1c/H113497%. This pro - portion of the population was signiﬁ-cantly greater than in the placebo arm(11% [11 subjects]; P/H110210.01 for pairwise comparisons). Similarly, for the evaluablepopulation with baseline HbA
