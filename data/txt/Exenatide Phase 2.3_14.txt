ﬁned as all randomized subjects whocompleted treatment through week 30and received at least 80% of the studymedication injections. Subjects whomissed 7 consecutive days of injectionsduring the last 2 months of the study wereexcluded. Safety analysis All safety analyses were performed usingthe ITT population. Treatment-emergentadverse events were deﬁned as those oc-curring upon or after receiving the ﬁrstrandomized dose. The intensity of hypo-glycemic episodes was deﬁned as mild/moderate or severe. For mild/moderatehypoglycemia, subjects reported symp-toms consistent with hypoglycemia thatmay have been documented by a plasmaglucose concentration value ( /H1102160 mg/dl). For severe hypoglycemia, subjects re-quired the assistance of another person toobtain treatment for their hypoglycemia,including intravenous glucose or intra-muscular glucagon. Assays
